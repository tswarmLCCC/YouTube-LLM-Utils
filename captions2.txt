1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:06,359
hello um in this video I am going to

2
00:00:03,879 --> 00:00:10,360
introduce GitHub classrooms and GitHub

3
00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:13,639
in general GitHub is a source control uh

4
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:17,720
mechanism or git is I should say git git

5
00:00:13,639 --> 00:00:20,039
um GitHub is a Microsoft owned uh repos

6
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:24,119
uh web web page where you can publish

7
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:25,840
your code um using the git mechanism um

8
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:27,760
and it will keep track of your code

9
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:30,240
changes uh keep track of different

10
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:33,239
versions of your code allow you to share

11
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:35,320
code and things like that um and uh what

12
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:37,600
we're going to use it for in particular

13
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:40,120
right now is sharing code back and forth

14
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:43,039
between uh you as a student and me as an

15
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:46,000
instructor we're going to do this U by

16
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:48,600
using a uh a a free product or not a

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,320
free product actually but um a product

18
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,920
that's free to us is a college called

19
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:56,120
GitHub classroom which allows me to

20
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:58,440
share some starter code uh with you and

21
00:00:56,120 --> 00:01:00,160
you will clone this into what are called

22
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:02,199
repositories

23
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,440
um and work on it um and then you'll

24
00:01:02,199 --> 00:01:06,520
submit that back to me so we're going to

25
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:10,040
go through that process of basically uh

26
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:12,320
using the GitHub platform um and version

27
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:15,240
controls to turn in our work this is

28
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:17,720
going to replace repet um the online um

29
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:20,079
uh code editor that we were using in um

30
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:22,840
fall of 2024 uh that changed their

31
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:25,240
licenses unfortunately and has made

32
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:27,240
things quite a a bit of a headache the

33
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:28,520
first thing you'll need to do and don't

34
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:30,560
worry you don't need to take notes on

35
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:33,159
this this will this this video will

36
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,479
accompany a page that has all of these

37
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:37,560
instructions as well the first thing

38
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:40,640
you'll need to do is go to github.com um

39
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:42,000
G hub.com and sign up for an account if

40
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,920
you don't already have one and if you

41
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,920
have one uh sign into it you can either

42
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:50,280
use your uh your school account or your

43
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:52,840
personal one um I'd recommend maybe

44
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:54,920
starting with your personal one if you

45
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:56,439
if you're comfortable with that that

46
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:58,600
won't matter though this code will not

47
00:01:56,439 --> 00:02:01,960
be attached to your your personal

48
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:04,360
account it will only be uh part of the

49
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:06,439
the school repository that I've set up

50
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:07,960
for grading um lots of details there

51
00:02:06,439 --> 00:02:10,599
that are be on the scope of this video

52
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:10,599
but go to

53
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:15,680
githubsign in and then what you're going

54
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:18,519
to do is you'll get a link uh from me

55
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:21,160
that looks something like this um it

56
00:02:18,519 --> 00:02:22,519
won't say this right away it'll say well

57
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:24,440
there'll be two steps involved first

58
00:02:22,519 --> 00:02:25,840
you'll get a link from me that says do

59
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:28,480
you want to join you know your

60
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:30,400
respective classroom that I'll set up um

61
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:32,120
uh pretty quick here um

62
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:35,360
and then within each assignment you'll

63
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:36,640
get a link within there uh uh that uh

64
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,480
will say do you want to accept this

65
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:41,120
assignment once you've accepted the

66
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:42,680
assignment um it will set up your

67
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:45,640
repository and that's what's going on

68
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:50,000
here it's creating a repository for you

69
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:51,000
um and uh you will um you uh it'll

70
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,680
create that and I'll show you what that

71
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,280
looks like in just a bit and then from

72
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:56,280
there you can actually just open that in

73
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:59,000
what are called GitHub code spaces code

74
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:00,760
spaces is an online editor and this is

75
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,319
the main reason we're going going here

76
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:05,360
is to use this online Editor to uh do

77
00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:07,560
our code editing and collaboration if we

78
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:09,440
need to um and and I'll walk you through

79
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:10,760
that process as well this is an

80
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,040
assignment that I've worked through a

81
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:13,680
couple times just to work out some of

82
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:16,599
the bugs and record different versions

83
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:18,120
of this video um uh so I'll I'll be

84
00:03:16,599 --> 00:03:21,040
making a few edits in there but we'll

85
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:23,879
use it to go through some of the uh some

86
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:25,760
of the existing uh functions so anyway

87
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:27,599
um you can go directly I'm going to go

88
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:31,519
go and close this you can go directly to

89
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:33,000
your repository um from here um it turns

90
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:34,519
out that this is one that I've done

91
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,480
after I've submitted it you can see some

92
00:03:34,519 --> 00:03:39,080
of these were just within the last few

93
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:41,040
minutes um but the uh what you might

94
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:43,760
just have here is like a read me that

95
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:45,560
says like hey here's how you you know

96
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:47,439
you do your your assignment this week

97
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:50,319
and then maybe some starter program like

98
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:52,599
main CPP here this is C++ code for those

99
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:53,920
of you in Python um but all of these

100
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:56,720
operations are the same they're just

101
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:58,439
different kinds of files is all um so

102
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:01,720
once you're in here uh you can certainly

103
00:03:58,439 --> 00:04:05,079
see which version of your files are the

104
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:06,920
most uh the the ones that were updated

105
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:08,680
last um if you've only cloned it

106
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:10,560
recently it will be just you know the

107
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:11,840
ones that you just copied but this is

108
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,439
the one you'll want to check this is

109
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:16,079
what I will be checking and you'll

110
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:18,000
notice here it tacked my uh my name on

111
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,440
here um not this is not me as the

112
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,919
instructor this is actually me as a test

113
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:24,360
student this is my Gmail version of my

114
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:26,800
GitHub accounts um but you'll see your

115
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:29,400
name here um leave that leave that the

116
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:31,600
same that's all fine um you don't need

117
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:33,039
to worry about uh anything like uh sing

118
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,960
forking you don't open your files from

119
00:04:33,039 --> 00:04:36,280
here although you can you can certainly

120
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:39,039
look at them and see what's in there

121
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:41,000
like like this uh things like that but

122
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:43,320
what you'll there's two things you'll

123
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,440
you'll be interested in here um you will

124
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:49,240
either want to just open in GitHub code

125
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:52,560
spaces directly or under code here uh

126
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:54,840
you you can get a local uh some some Ser

127
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:57,440
different kinds of local ways to uh

128
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:59,160
download this so if you're using GitHub

129
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:02,639
uh the the command line interface you

130
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:05,280
can actually actually um just uh you can

131
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:07,479
you know clone the URL um or you can

132
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:09,160
download it with GitHub desktop if you

133
00:05:07,479 --> 00:05:10,600
choose to go that route there's some

134
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:12,039
instructions for that in the uh

135
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:14,000
accompanying instructions but that's not

136
00:05:12,039 --> 00:05:16,000
what we're going to do today instead

137
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,759
what we're going to do is we're going to

138
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,560
go to code spaces and uh I've got two

139
00:05:18,759 --> 00:05:22,280
here one of them is actually active but

140
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:26,639
I'm going to set up a new one for for us

141
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:28,960
today that uh is going to clone our uh

142
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:30,400
or make a a new code space so you

143
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,440
wouldn't have these these are only

144
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,840
because and you know what I'm going to

145
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:35,440
even delete these uh can I can I delete

146
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:37,280
those real quick yep I'm going to just

147
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:39,080
delete these real quick because I don't

148
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:41,160
need them hopefully it doesn't take too

149
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:43,000
long I'm going to go delete this other

150
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:45,039
one that I have going on I'm going to

151
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,280
stop it first because it's active and

152
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:49,520
then I'm going to and then I'm going to

153
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:52,440
go delete that one as well uh because I

154
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:54,759
do not need it for what I'm doing right

155
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:57,440
now so now that those are deleted I'm

156
00:05:54,759 --> 00:05:59,960
going to make a new code space on main

157
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:03,400
main here is the branch of the code I'm

158
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:05,400
using um and we'll come back to that but

159
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:07,120
uh what what main means is basically

160
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:09,960
I've got one version of the code so if I

161
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:11,720
was writing um and maybe I've got a

162
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:13,400
stable branch of the code and then

163
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:15,800
something I wanted to experiment you can

164
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:18,039
actually Branch your code within GitHub

165
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:19,680
um and I encourage you to look that up

166
00:06:18,039 --> 00:06:22,319
as you have time I'm not going to go

167
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:24,639
into that today but uh know that that's

168
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:26,880
an option but that's what main here is

169
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:29,240
create a code space on Main is basically

170
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:31,000
saying using the main branch of my code

171
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:32,960
you can that's the one I'm looking at

172
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,639
right here uh it's going to create a

173
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,400
code space which is the online editor so

174
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:38,520
I'm going to create that and it's going

175
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:41,000
to start to fire that up what uh

176
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:44,000
codespace is as you can probably start

177
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,160
to see is um it looks a lot like vs code

178
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,919
for those of you that you've used it so

179
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:54,280
it's it's going to create that and again

180
00:06:48,919 --> 00:06:56,800
this is only from um this repository so

181
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:59,840
this is what matters and all these files

182
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:01,639
that I have here are going to be there

183
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:04,319
um as soon as this gets

184
00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:07,199
done so uh I don't know what's going

185
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:09,039
here let's take a quick look H that's

186
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:11,240
okay um what it's doing here is telling

187
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:13,599
me it doesn't have a build file uh which

188
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:16,000
we might add I didn't add them uh for

189
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:17,120
our C++ classes yet but that's probably

190
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,199
something we don't need to worry about

191
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:22,960
just yet um so if I open uh this this

192
00:07:20,199 --> 00:07:24,759
main file main CPP might be the file

193
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:27,039
that I'm working on and you'll notice

194
00:07:24,759 --> 00:07:29,039
that it kind of tries to recognize that

195
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:31,120
hey you don't have an extension for this

196
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:33,520
extension are add-ins to this that are

197
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:36,520
under this tab this little block tab

198
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:39,680
here that help us help uh Visual Studio

199
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:41,240
coder in this CL code space vs code um

200
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:44,440
understand what we're doing and how to

201
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:46,440
run the code in the in the case of C++

202
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:49,240
it needs to know um how to compile and

203
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:51,639
Link files and then um in the case of

204
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:54,520
python it's just the python interpreter

205
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:56,360
um either way uh it will probably prompt

206
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:58,800
you to install it and and certainly you

207
00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:02,599
want to do that um for the C++ you'll

208
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:05,120
want the C+ plus extension pack um and

209
00:08:02,599 --> 00:08:06,440
uh in Python you will want just it's

210
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,639
just called Python and I'll show you

211
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:09,319
that in just a sec too so I'm going to

212
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:10,840
go and click install here but if that

213
00:08:09,319 --> 00:08:12,199
doesn't show up for some reason and it's

214
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:13,479
going to open a tab and do that for me

215
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:16,080
I'll go and close that because I don't

216
00:08:13,479 --> 00:08:19,039
really need that tab um it went to it

217
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:21,240
went from here which I was in um in the

218
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:23,560
Explorer it went to extensions here and

219
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:25,120
you can see it's starting to install it

220
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:26,720
now it's asking if it wants me to use an

221
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:29,159
experimental version which I I actually

222
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:31,879
don't um but the other thing I can do is

223
00:08:29,159 --> 00:08:33,880
if if if I was going in for Python and

224
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:36,039
um for some reason it didn't show up uh

225
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:38,440
this I can get rid of all this stuff and

226
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:40,360
I could type Python and I can show you

227
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:41,919
which one we'd want to use for that it'd

228
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:43,440
be just it's just called Python and it's

229
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:45,600
called Python language support it's

230
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,600
built in from Microsoft it'll work just

231
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:50,279
fine for what we're doing for almost all

232
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:52,320
of our code um we might have one little

233
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:54,200
issue when we get to the uh games

234
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:56,800
programming unit that I might have to

235
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:58,120
rethink uh that we set up in repet uh

236
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:00,160
but other than that we should be just

237
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:02,200
fine so if you want to do install python

238
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:03,560
you can there for some reason I haven't

239
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:05,800
figured out how to make these things

240
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:07,480
stick yet uh where you don't have to do

241
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:09,920
this every time but you should only have

242
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:11,680
to do it at worst once a week for your

243
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:14,680
code space and then once you're set up

244
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:16,959
like I said um that that will now be uh

245
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:19,600
let me go and refresh this uh go ahead

246
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:21,800
and refresh my my repository you can see

247
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,839
here that that now exists and it gives

248
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:26,800
it a funky name but um I could go to

249
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:28,720
there from here if I hadn't yep and it's

250
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:31,360
saying it's code space is being paid for

251
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:33,800
by tor it's not it's it's actually being

252
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:36,480
paid for by the college and by paid for

253
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:38,680
I mean it's free to us given based on an

254
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:40,079
agreement but don't go running like

255
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:42,600
infinite loops and leaving them running

256
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:43,800
forever there is a limit to these things

257
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:46,079
um but I don't think we're going to run

258
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:49,000
into them anytime soon for our work

259
00:09:46,079 --> 00:09:51,240
anyway going back to the code space um

260
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,200
so let's pretend uh this code and like I

261
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:56,640
said I'd already done this but let's say

262
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:58,519
I I uh was wanting to do well here let's

263
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:00,000
let's just change this so instead of

264
00:09:58,519 --> 00:10:01,880
hello world say I wanted to do it with

265
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,839
exclamation marks but let's say I just

266
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:07,279
my whole problem was to add this hello

267
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:10,320
world right so I add this and I save it

268
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:13,320
that's a hit control s behind the scenes

269
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:15,920
um and uh what happens then is you might

270
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:18,000
have notied this m popped up over here

271
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:20,279
this and that means it was modified

272
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,959
that's the source control showing you

273
00:10:20,279 --> 00:10:25,880
and this is an Explorer what's going on

274
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:29,120
um that that this was modified um so if

275
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:33,000
I go to the uh console here let's just

276
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:34,680
go go to a console uh terminal I'm sorry

277
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,440
um there's two ways I can actually

278
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:41,399
submit this so you notice here that when

279
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:42,839
I go into um when I go into main CPP

280
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:44,839
here you can just see that it's hello

281
00:10:42,839 --> 00:10:47,040
world without exclamation marks that's

282
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:49,800
the version I had here um but that might

283
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:51,920
just be a blank or to-do or you know the

284
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:53,480
prim exercises or things like that those

285
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,880
would exist here but you want to update

286
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:56,519
this file you want to get this here and

287
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:58,160
you notice I just saved this but it

288
00:10:56,519 --> 00:10:59,920
didn't go there well there's a couple

289
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:01,480
ways we can do that

290
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:05,040
the first thing we can do is we can add

291
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:07,880
the file to uh to get tracking and we

292
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:09,800
can use the command uh get let's see is

293
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:11,600
that showing up properly no it's just a

294
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:14,440
little too small I'm going to shrink my

295
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:17,160
window hopefully you can see this after

296
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:20,920
I there we go get there um get and then

297
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:22,920
I can do get ad and then I can do

298
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:25,040
main.cpp and it turns out that was

299
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:26,600
already in there for me uh because I

300
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:29,600
submitted it earlier but that's

301
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:31,120
basically adding this to the tracking is

302
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,959
is how we would do that so there's three

303
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:35,000
commands that you'll need at the very

304
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:36,839
minimum the first one is that and then

305
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:40,880
the second one is you have to do what's

306
00:11:36,839 --> 00:11:43,839
called commit you have to commit your um

307
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:46,240
you have to commit your change uh and

308
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:48,320
and commit means basically this is what

309
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:52,440
I want I've done the file editing now

310
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:57,440
and I'm committing this to to a a a

311
00:11:52,440 --> 00:12:00,160
change for GitHub and that looks um oops

312
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:02,279
dang it sorry I thought I had

313
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:03,760
a copy paste going on there but it's

314
00:12:02,279 --> 00:12:06,200
pretty simple command so I can just type

315
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:08,920
it it's just get

316
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:11,040
commit so that's the big part of it and

317
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:14,480
then the last part you want is uh you

318
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:17,800
need to give it a um you need to give it

319
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:19,639
a uh a commit message and we use the

320
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:24,959
flag there-

321
00:12:19,639 --> 00:12:24,959
M and we say you know um

322
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:32,000
resubmit with exclamation

323
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:34,360
marks think I mistype that but the main

324
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,480
point is that we need this M for the

325
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:38,360
message and then resubmit with

326
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,720
exclamation marks if I tried to commit

327
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:42,399
without that it would give you an error

328
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:45,040
saying you have to give it um that that

329
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:48,320
message so you'll see here that we we

330
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:50,720
basically made that main main uh commit

331
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:53,440
that's a check-in for lack of a better

332
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:55,639
term and now that that's saved here and

333
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:57,120
we could do more of those here and it

334
00:12:55,639 --> 00:12:59,279
the cool thing about it is if you ever

335
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:01,279
mess up your work you can go back to any

336
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:02,680
commit um there's ways to do that again

337
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:04,800
beyond the scope of what we're doing but

338
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:09,519
that's what we mean by Version

339
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:12,480
Control every time we do a commit we are

340
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:14,440
basically um basically making a version

341
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:16,839
of our program so if you start out on

342
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:18,519
your final and you you know write print

343
00:13:16,839 --> 00:13:20,959
hello world you could commit that and

344
00:13:18,519 --> 00:13:22,639
you know you're going and then you maybe

345
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:24,320
import your libraries you could commit

346
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:26,160
that and then you can always build upon

347
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:28,399
that and you can you know be running

348
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:30,040
these the whole time uh which I I I

349
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:31,519
recommend you do

350
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:33,480
um and as as a matter of fact I haven't

351
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:36,639
even gone over that yet I just realized

352
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:38,040
so nvs code um just like when we added

353
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:40,480
the extensions you might have noticed

354
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:43,279
that this wasn't here this little um

355
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:45,720
Plus or this little bug debugger thing

356
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:47,079
going on here it wasn't here before um I

357
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:51,040
just realized you can't see quite there

358
00:13:47,079 --> 00:13:53,240
we go um or or this one this run C++

359
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:55,920
file but once I added the extension

360
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:57,800
these pop in so I'm going to run the C++

361
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:59,279
program and it's going to ask me a whole

362
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:00,639
bunch of questions like do you want to

363
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:03,000
do all this stuff with make files and

364
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:04,480
things like that which I don't right now

365
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,759
um I'm going to it's just going to go

366
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:10,399
through here and eventually it's going

367
00:14:06,759 --> 00:14:11,920
to produce our hello uh output fil I

368
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:13,480
think this is still stemming from that

369
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:15,360
earlier thing so I'm going to actually

370
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:17,519
do the whole thing again and we should

371
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,800
before too long get our hello world with

372
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:23,360
our exclamation mark so that's how we

373
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:25,759
run that right um or of course uh we

374
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:29,160
could do things like we could run the

375
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:30,320
g++ compiler and we could say uh compile

376
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:34,360
file

377
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:36,800
main.cpp to an output file called main.

378
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:39,759
out right um these are things that we do

379
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:41,320
in C++ to get things running um and then

380
00:14:39,759 --> 00:14:45,120
we could actually even submit the out

381
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:48,079
file by adding it um to our uh

382
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:51,480
repository like so actually I think I've

383
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:55,279
got two different terminals yep uh this

384
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:59,399
one so now I can go back and I could add

385
00:14:55,279 --> 00:15:02,440
our main do uh out file and you'll see

386
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:06,959
it change here from Green now it's going

387
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:11,639
to be tracked and then I can uh commit

388
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:14,240
that uh resubmit with an out

389
00:15:11,639 --> 00:15:15,399
file and that's going to commit that and

390
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,720
now those are committed all those

391
00:15:15,399 --> 00:15:21,000
changes are committed but you'll notice

392
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:22,639
here that still we do not I'm going to

393
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,920
refresh this just to prove it we don't

394
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:25,800
have those exclamation marks and as a

395
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:28,319
matter of

396
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:29,639
fact we don't have that main. out file

397
00:15:28,319 --> 00:15:31,519
here either

398
00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:33,920
we have some other stuff well the way

399
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:37,160
the way we finish this whole Loop is we

400
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:40,959
have to do uh a command called get push

401
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:42,839
get push origin main is the full command

402
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:44,240
and again I I give these to you in the

403
00:15:42,839 --> 00:15:46,680
uh in the module so don't worry about

404
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:48,519
that uh remember but what this means uh

405
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:50,199
let me go and expand this just a bit

406
00:15:48,519 --> 00:15:52,480
because I don't like that it Scrolls I

407
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:54,319
want you to be able to see most of this

408
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:58,480
in this little window like so there we

409
00:15:54,319 --> 00:16:01,480
go um get get gets the again the program

410
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:04,759
push be is basically saying take this

411
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:07,240
repository and move it somewhere push it

412
00:16:04,759 --> 00:16:10,800
um so origin is kind of the weird one

413
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:13,279
here origin is an alias uh that's set up

414
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:16,160
for you when you when it was when this

415
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:19,399
uh was cloned origin is basically this

416
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:22,880
URL up here it's saying go to GitHub and

417
00:16:19,399 --> 00:16:24,399
and and uh and and uh and push it there

418
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:26,759
and if you had done this with GitHub

419
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:28,560
proper as opposed to code space here it

420
00:16:26,759 --> 00:16:30,880
would actually have you log in and

421
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:32,720
author eyes and make sure that you had

422
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:35,839
rights to push to this that it was

423
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:39,160
actually yours um but uh that's what's

424
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:42,440
going on there is that you are uh you're

425
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:44,560
getting ready to push it uh to origin or

426
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:46,800
that URL so this is just basically a

427
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:48,959
shortcut or shorthand for that URL that

428
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:52,079
goes to your thing and then finally main

429
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:53,800
is the main branch it's not main CPP or

430
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:56,160
anything like that those are not related

431
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:59,360
in this case uh that could be confusing

432
00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:01,319
I realize it's actually this brand and

433
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:03,440
we only have one branch here called main

434
00:17:01,319 --> 00:17:04,880
but if you had more than one you could

435
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,720
you could uh push it to different

436
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:08,559
branches instead that's not what we're

437
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:11,000
doing here but you need all of this so

438
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:14,600
you need get you need push you need

439
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:16,959
either the URL or the uh um Alias of the

440
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:19,400
URL in this case called origin and then

441
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:21,640
the branch and once I do that it's going

442
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:23,799
to basically push that and we'll see

443
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:25,919
then finally when we go back to our

444
00:17:23,799 --> 00:17:27,839
repository and refresh this we're going

445
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:29,840
to see all of these changes that we we

446
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:31,640
uh made we made you know so we see the

447
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:33,640
one with the out file the one with the

448
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:35,520
exclamation marks and things like that

449
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:37,840
those where those comments come and then

450
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:40,400
you this was this would be linked to

451
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:43,039
Google classrooms uh I'm sorry GitHub

452
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:45,480
classrooms and I would be able to then

453
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:47,799
um to to grade it for you and get

454
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:50,280
feedback um so there's another way to do

455
00:17:47,799 --> 00:17:52,880
all of this let's say I now want one

456
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:55,840
with only two exclamation marks and I

457
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:57,600
save it um now again Main's modified

458
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:59,799
right just like we saw before and it's

459
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:03,120
actually saying hey uh

460
00:17:59,799 --> 00:18:04,679
our main program our out file is also

461
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:07,440
because that got created when I ran up

462
00:18:04,679 --> 00:18:08,960
here that's a binary file um it turns

463
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:10,799
out you don't have to use those commands

464
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:13,880
if you don't want to down here the git

465
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:17,120
git uh ad all that you can use this this

466
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:18,919
Source control here within vs code if

467
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:20,480
you do that you'll notice we've got a

468
00:18:18,919 --> 00:18:22,960
couple things here like I can open the

469
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:24,240
file I can discard the file if I want to

470
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,919
which I'm actually going to do for this

471
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:28,799
one because I don't really care about

472
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:30,760
that one yep I don't care about that one

473
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:33,720
but this one I want to add I want to

474
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:34,720
Stage it so this is again getting

475
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:37,080
getting ready and you can see it's

476
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:40,440
staged now it went from changes to Stage

477
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:42,640
changes and then finally I can unstage

478
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:45,080
it here if I wanted to push this button

479
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:46,320
then lastly I've got this commit and

480
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:49,000
what I'm going to do instead is I'm

481
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:51,640
going to commit and push um there's a

482
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,919
built-in command for that here which is

483
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:55,240
really nice uh once I do that though I'm

484
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:56,640
going to see a slightly different thing

485
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:58,400
than what I saw before because you got

486
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:00,480
to remember you have to have a comment

487
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:03,000
for these things so when I do that it's

488
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:06,880
basically going to say hey do you want

489
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:08,600
to uh you have to add a comment a commit

490
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:10,720
message right that's what's going on

491
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:13,600
here we did this before you might recall

492
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:16,159
with that M and then and then the thing

493
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:19,159
let's see if I still got it here we did

494
00:19:16,159 --> 00:19:21,840
that before by by using this m down here

495
00:19:19,159 --> 00:19:23,400
this guy and this this message that's

496
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,919
what we're do going to do here so I can

497
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:27,559
change this I can actually just delete

498
00:19:24,919 --> 00:19:30,120
all this or I can say changes to be

499
00:19:27,559 --> 00:19:32,120
committ so say I don't want any of those

500
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:34,360
um and then I I'm going to uncomment

501
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:37,039
these because the comments don't matter

502
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:41,799
but I'm going to say

503
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:43,520
removed exclamation or two exclamation

504
00:19:41,799 --> 00:19:46,840
marks something like that something

505
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:48,440
simple right um so as long as I've got

506
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:49,840
anything in here that's not a comment

507
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:51,159
we're going to be able to do this and

508
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:53,000
the way you do it from here is you

509
00:19:51,159 --> 00:19:55,520
actually accept the commit message and

510
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:57,600
then of course this all up it goes and

511
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:59,480
it's going to ask you to do that so

512
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,600
again you can do that all that stuff

513
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:02,720
with this and you can see there's

514
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:04,799
nothing else changing here until I go in

515
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:06,880
here and I make another modification

516
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:09,760
then then they'll start to show up here

517
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:12,280
and I I could go in and do all of that

518
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:14,520
again so two different ways to do it but

519
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:17,320
you'll notice now our new one shows up

520
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:20,200
in here and we got the new exclamation

521
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:23,039
mark uh for this I can actually read

522
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:25,799
this and you can see the changes that I

523
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:27,760
made when I click on that and you can do

524
00:20:25,799 --> 00:20:29,400
that for any commit actually it's really

525
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:32,240
slick

526
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:35,320
um any any of that that's that's GitHub

527
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:37,600
in a nutshell so that will be available

528
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:40,679
for me and it's LinkedIn classroom and

529
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:42,200
then I could uh grade it and uh there's

530
00:20:40,679 --> 00:20:44,280
other things we can use some other

531
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:46,320
extensions um I can't remember the name

532
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:48,159
of it give me one sec let's see if I can

533
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:52,760
find it real quick

534
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:55,200
um there's a get there's another uh

535
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:58,240
extension that you can enable uh let's
