hello welcome to class um I want to I'm going to make a quick video here just to kind of Orient you during uh the first week here with the different parts of class unfortunately I'm unable to do this live um during the day at least because I'll be at a conference that first week of class um uh and this is an asynchronous class so it's probably good to have this online anyway we might not have uh people um necessarily on on campus or are available um during the evening I am going to try to host a sync session um during the week uh of of the first week of class and do the same thing here but I want to record this and just make sure that we have something available uh available for on the first day of class if nothing else so we'll see how see how the scheduling goes um let's see uh this is uh computer science uh and we're we're going to be teaching uh python here um we're actually using a very similar shelf for two different classes CC 1010 and 2409 um they the reason for that is we used to teach Java in um in computer science 1010 but we've gone away from that um Java is kind of a a language that's not used as quite as frequently out of out of college anymore um so we we're moving that to Python and then but we we we have many students who um took uh 1010 in Java and haven't had the opportunity to have python so we're going to also use 2409 to teach that um there will be a few more advanced topics in 2409 but the the the general uh workflow will be exactly the same and most of the assignments will be the exactly the same uh we just go a little deeper into a few topics of 2409 um main difference between the two there so um I might be referring to both in this in this because we're we're kind of using not the same shell but very similar in both um let's see like I said this is an asynchronous class which means we will not meet live you're not required to take any live lecture time with me um although we will have Labs available um on Wednesday afternoon I believe I think we will be up in um the um eec the education enrichment center on the second floor um right there uh right as you come across that that walkway and then on uh Thursday morning will'll be in BT 222 but again those might change I I I um um those are basically what we're calling office hours so I can't reserve them uh or I can get bumped from those as a way to say it um check the uh um the weekly or the uh the course startup here um I will um I will certainly keep that uh this part up here updated with what we're doing there um as well so this is this first page here um by the way in our module is uh that I've referenced is this um weekly uh uh or the course startup this very first one um and I'm just using that to kind of document what I'm going to go through here as well as the syllabus um the uh let's see I don't I'm trying to think how I want to do this I'm going to I'm going to get the two biggies out of the way right away um the first week make sure no matter what else you do that you take this uh this quiz I'm sorry this quiz this week one quiz that's due on the 19th um and it's uh basically are are you actually in this class or should we drop you quiz so if you don't get that done by the 19th it's it's a Friday I want to say um then I have to drop you so and especially in 1010 there's quite a few students on the wait list so make sure you take that and claim your space in class um the uh the both classes also will have a very simple um hello world type uh our very first program um and that's really just making sure that you have the other big thing done which is getting your python environment set up uh which I've written a page here for uh we um you don't have to use Visual Studio code you can use whatever you want um but I do recommend that you use Visual Studio code you do need to produce files though for me um so these will either be Standalone python files that you'll submit uh to me or you you'll zip up uh using this you know wind M the the the windows zip uh or or 7even zip or whatever you want zip these things up and send them to me if you got more than one file or you'd like to include some documentation all of that's fine uh with me um this is Visual Studio code uh which is a nice free program available for Mac Linux and PC um and there's some really nice features in here that I think you will enjoy programming with um so I wrot wrote a a fairly uh in-depth guide here and uh and I refer back to visual studio code um more than anything else um we'll get to the syllabus in just a sec which includes bits on the outline and Grading um and um besides my office hours oops I didn't realize I haven't updated this I need to update my my contact information here I'm in bt2 13 upstairs and my phone number uh is um I'm just going to update that real quick hold on just grab it from syllabus just make sure that gets done sorry still cleaning it up still cleaning up the shells these uh have gone through quite a bit of an over overhaul here where is that sucker at there we go uh well this is just my email I know that one and uh there we go get this update properly for you um they're they're in the syllabus though so they're certainly there as well um let's see just in canus I'm going to come back I'm going to come back uh uh I'm going to go through the syllabus now um let's see makeing sure I'm not missing anything yeah let's go through the syllabus here go over to here yeah there it comes up um so uh this is um this is the 1010 syllabus like I mentioned so you'll see mention that but 249 is pretty much exactly the same oops just realized I deleted my phone over there instead of updating it um this needs to be updated as well I'll update it properly later but um this is just the time I was able to get basically what this will be um is T or I'm sorry uh Wednesday and Thursday is that what I had no uh Wednesday sorry about this Wednesday on 2 to 4 and that'll be over in E if things don't change and Thursday morning from 9 to 11 and I chose uh one one afternoon and one um uh one one afternoon and one morning to better accommodate your schedules but if we need to move these that's fine with me I'm usually I'm pretty open all my classes are asynchronous um I want to be available for you and then then of course you can always schedule office hours during during those blocks as well um let's see the uh main thing about communicating VI email just make sure you put you whichever class you're in either cc1010 or 2049 2409 in the subject so I know which class we're talking about and I can find you a little bit easier it's a little hard to navigate um all all of the sections and and tracking down names without that um let's see the first uh day of class is the 16th um which is a Tuesday make sure you get that quiz done by that during that week um it's mention there and then the only other thing is the um live I don't know why I put that in there because that is not true let's just get rid of that all together I think that was from a previous syllabus um the last day is Friday May 10th and we'll have instruction that week but your finals will go the week until the week after that you'll have another week for your uh final projects if you need them um let's see you can uh receive a 100% refund if you drop by the 29th if you choose to do so and you will not receive any mark on your transcript after that you will um and you can um let you can can still withdraw up through April 1st but there's a penalty financially if you wait past January 29th excuse me this class is a python class um it's a class on actually it's a class on computational thinking both classes are um I I follow um if you're familiar with cs50 uh from Harvard I follow that philosophy but I go a little more in depth on the coding lessons than the they do um but I really like how they've taught and I I reference them quite frequently um if you ever want supplemental material to this um um they teach it and see I think but um I really enjoy the way they talk about things like memory and and some of the other uh Concepts uh so it's a great class uh and that that's kind of the general Phil philosophy of what we're doing uh um I'd uh estimate this is probably true uh between the coding and collaboration 68 hours a week seems fairly uh fairly uh about right we'll go over what that means what what you will you'll be spending that time on in just a sec um student work this is kind of the the the plagiarism part um you're more than welcome to work with your uh your classmates and even use um large language models like chat GPT and things like that to help you but not do your work um if I suspect that that you're having having uh having you know a large language model write all your stuff or or your buddy write all your stuff um I'm going to I'll call you I'll contact you or get a hold of you and I'll have you walk you walk me through what you did in your assignment and um I'll probably do that anyway just to make sure that we're all on the same page and things are well understood um it's not meant to be punitive it's just kind of the world we live in right now I want to make sure that you're getting this and that when we we assign a grade at the end of this thing that it's something you've earned and and and that you can do um not just that you learned how to type things into Chad jpt um so that that what that's that what's that that is what's that is what that part is all about um the course materials uh we have what's called a zybook it's an online resource um both classes use the same one they're named differently obviously um because we have to adopt them per section but what they are are their guided learning environments and I'll show you what they look like when I go back over to uh canvas here but um the they're they're 20% of your grade um they they actually track your activity make sure you do the reading and do the activities within this is basically what uh what's mimicking um if you were sitting in in a classroom with me and I would you know ask you a question that's why I chose this resource it will say you know what's wrong with this code and you and you and you try to try to figure that out right there um if you have questions certainly get a hold of me but you should these things are pretty pretty straightforward and it helps you quite a bit um it's a really good way to uh it's a really engaging resource that's why I chose it um and uh I think it's better than what a lot of online classes do for computer programming I'm pretty happy with the way that that's turned out um this is a bit bit of the the requirements of getting a three years iBook making sure you get that purchase through the bookstore but also getting a visual studio code up and running um uh make sure sure you do that as soon as possible really early in week one uh the course competencies are here this are basically what we promise that you will learn um very high level stuff here um attendance things like that some drop dates uh things like that uh just stuff we've already covered the grading uh the homework is 30% of your grade these are weekly assignments that are due on Friday night um and they will have a lot of layers so you'll go through Reading and then a lecture and then um some online code examples that kind of scaffold up to the actual assignment and then the assignment itself hopefully by the time you get to that last part the assignment itself is very almost too easy for you I'm hoping that's the case I hope that these are structured where that's almost just a checkbox at the end of the week um and that's due by uh by uh Friday evening there's a a a discussion post requirement as well as you might see here um which are the which I'm sorry it's not that it's the this that's 20% of your grade um discussions um the uh the first post uh in cvas is due on Wednesday night and that should be your own post don't don't like copy anybody else's and change it I want you to write your own this is basically your your response to the prompt and I'll talk about that in just a sec and then by Friday night then you do respond to one other of your student of your of your um of your of your uh classmates the midterm and final are 15% each so that would that's basically 30% is is that category um they're not that hard really frankly and the the thing um that we we did um you'll design this throughout the class so uh in a module you'll study a topic let's call it Loops I think it's in week four or week four or five um you'll study Loops you'll go through the the the reading you'll do the assignment you'll have plenty of lectures uh and all that should be done really early it opens on Saturday the modules will open on Saturday um and I might even open up ahead of time your first response though is due uh or I'm sorry what you'll do uh with that is you'll discuss how that relates to the final or the midterm um so that's basically what the discussions are for is to design your final adenture as a class as we go so you'll be building this as we go um you can start the final in midterm anytime uh and and ask me questions about it anytime um when I go back to the canvas show I'll show you I'll walk you through that uh grading very simple uh you know very similar to what we've done in other things uh another bit on academic um Integrity this is just coming from the college instead of you know what I wrote up above about chat jbt uh audit disclaimer stuff this is just kind of for your reference if you ever come back to this and you need to show somebody what what you learned um I just put a list of of of what we what we're doing in here for you um the order of this may change and things like that um and then some other college stuff uh I think the main thing I want to make you aware of in here are the tutoring uh that's available downstairs in the tutoring center it's free down by the library and [Music] um the other one was accessibility I'm not sure exactly where it is in here um it's here somewhere accommodations there we go if if for some reason um you need some accommodations to help with the class um please uh let um student services know they're the the ones best equipped to help me help you with that um and and they have much better training there uh you will need a computer for this class it's a programming class um you can use your own um install Visual Studio code or anything else there um or you can use the labs the computer labs um we'll have those set up um uh uh we can get those set up make sure Visual Studio codes on those let me know if they're not or if you have problems with that um I can I can help uh help set that up for you um and lastly the U the library has several computers that should be able to run Visual Studio code Force as well so feel free to make use of those let's see I think that's it for syllabus yeah in the grading due dates oh um make sure sure so everything the the the class or you know the due dates are as I mentioned Wednesday and Friday don't wait till the end if you if you email me on Friday at 11 o'clock at night I'm probably not going to help you out don't don't don't don't put things off and say I need an extension you know um you know things got away for me um you know if it's a real emergency okay you know we'll we'll figure it out um something comes up with your family family or you know something you know just really you get sick at the last second um I I'll buy that I guess once but um you know I've played those games too I mean we all have right don't do you know let's treat each other like adults here is kind of what I'm saying um uh let me know if you're if you're going to have problems meeting a deadline well before it's do and we we'll talk about extensions and things like that um not not not going to like you fall behind because we kind of move it a pretty good clip here and if you fall behind you're going to stay behind and we're not going to have that's going to just be a recipe for disaster so um the the due dates are there for a reason it's not to not not just to be mean we need to keep on keep keep the pace so those are those are the check boxes that we have to check so let me go back to Chrome and we'll go back into our um our uh our our our our startup stuff let's see let's I want to show you a discussion just to see what they look like um let's see do I have one set up for this let's go down to like here I haven't set all these up yet I apologize I need to go back through let's find one here yeah here here's a good one so this prompt is not it's not a very good one I I've done this in the other ones I I need this is that's actually the last thing I need to do that's fine one yeah is this the one I was looking for I think it is yeah um so we are calculating um the odds of winning a basketball game when we're down um when we uh talk about this one talking about functions um we can model you know using functions and we will uh that's what you'll be discussing so you'll again reply to this by Wednesday evening for your first prompt and then by Friday evening responding to one of your classmates um the zy books Let's go ahead and open one go and open the 2409 one just because we've been picking on um picking on uh on 101 enough you'll have these guided learning assignments and basically what these are is you'll go through and you will uh read um these aren't read to you unfortunately I thought that would be cool I kind of thought they were when I first considered it you'll notice there's a lot of quizzes and things like that but um a lot a lot of your time will be spent doing that so you um you hit start here and it's going to describe a loop what's going on here or an example of of what we're doing with loops um and things like that and then you'll see here um some then they they don't let you just click click click they want you to pay attention just like I would have you pay attention in class I know it's a little um you know pedantic but it's part of what we do and then you'll notice when it finishes here you'll get this checkbox and make sure these check boxes get checked here that's what's going to ship your progress back over to Canvas and I can grade it if you have problems with it let me know um I I understand that there's sometimes issues with these things but uh it looks like it's going to work quite nicely for us um there's a ton of other things in in this book uh that you can get um all these additional labs are available to you I think need to figure out why that's say hidden but all of the other stuff that's not assigned you can certainly um you can certainly do as well um but these are just what was required and it it will guide you through this so like as I get let's go back to that what I was just doing so you get down here to the bottom it will just say go to the next thing that that's how that works oh I guess you can't see that one sec uh let me shrink that down sorry my monitor is just a little bit bigger than the recording will allow let's just trying to grab the stinky thing having trouble grabbing a window you know let's just do let's just do this so resize it nicely for us there we go uh so is I go down to the bottom you should you'll see like the next thing this while Loops thing here so that's how that works um back to here then so like I said uh make sure that you go through and set up your python environment um I G uh giving you some instructions on how to do that with Visual Studio code here pretty self-explanatory and I also talk about it in several videos um and uh things like that um some helpful tips there um I've kind of outlined what you will do in the uh week to week here basically what we just covered you'll read the zbook you'll do um the reading you'll do the discussion posts you and so on and so forth and then Friday by midnight you'll do the rest of the stuff right um pretty straightforward but it's right there in week one as well um in this in this weekly schedule and tips for Success um the assignment has a very similar um thing where it talks about how to do the assignment and download it basically every week you'll download a zip file you'll move it to a directory I give you an example of what you might do here to keep it um organized you'll unpack it do the work um and turn in the homework that's basically it uh you'll submit these as files in canvas um if there's just one file you can just uh include the the python file POI extension if you've got multip files and you want to do documentation things like that you can zip them up and send that um I think that's kind of it I just wanted to really give you guys a course a big overview of everything we'll be doing right away um so is here if you want to read about me I'm here um but really come up and see me um I'm I'm thrilled to be on campus um and helping you guys I uh we haven't had a computer science instructor delc for a while um and I'm really excited to uh bring back that that spirit and camaraderie and all of that I hope you uh take advantage of the fact that we have somebody on campus now um as opposed to ad junks and and come see me I I really want to see you um so make sure in week one you do the quiz and you get things set up um I think that's it I think that's it so um I'm going to try to do um a qu at least a question and answer thing on uh one of the evenings there of that first week of class but if if for some reason that doesn't happen um you know please email me or or or or uh you know stop by the next week but really email me that first week um and I'll be able to get back as as soon soon as uh I can all right uh thank you welcome to class and I can't wait to start teaching you guys thank you
