a very common operation um using dictionaries and list in this case we're actually using dictionaries uh we'll we'll come back to dictionaries in a bit uh but let's just call them sequences um is to manipulate these things as We're looping over them right so what we're doing here is basically looking at a list of names and seeing if they're active or inactive and if they're inactive we want to delete them right um You might think that you could just basically uh do um do do that operation just by deleting it and I know there's some syntax in here that uh in my lectures I haven't covered but you certainly will have in the reading by now uh but the short version is when you you can delete an an an item from a uh sequence in this case a dictionary by using the delete command and giving it the object to remove from it so that's functionally what's going on here um and it's doing it based on the the value of a dictionary remember that in dictionaries there's names and values right so that's separated by a colon um so this is the value of of the uh of of the uh item at that location so this is still location zero it's got a name of hands which we could of course use if we wanted to um and then uh and then it's got a value of active or inactive right so if they're inactive it wants to remove that that's what we're doing here um and then the other thing that's happening that's new here is we're basically uh grabbing the uh user and Status um this looks a little different than what we did with the um list remember uh so in dictionaries you can grab both the name and the value with a comma separated assignment uh because they get both of those if you don't want to do that you can specify that you want the name or the value uh uh and we'll cover that in dictionaries but that's what's going on here uh but the thing I wanted to cover here more than anything is that because this sequence wants to work on uh on on the thing you're operating on it's best to make a copy and we can do that with the copy command where it's literally just making a temporary copy so here we're doing users. copy um so this is not now working on the original one uh for the uh purposes of iteration so this will iterate over the full thing because it's copied regardless if if if we remove things in the middle of it um it which is a good practice so if you find yourself having to change uh or especially delete things or add things to things in Flight um when you're iterating over them it it's really good practice to make a copy and there's two ways to do that of course we could make a um we can make a copy explicitly or you can just do it in line here so there's nothing nothing wrong with like other copy doing it like this we could certainly make a copy of users like this and then and then iterate over that and then what we're doing is we're actually you know deleting from the original and that's why we we'd want to do something like that the same thing is true of addition where we might want to be um basically so in this case instead of deleting and we're adding things these people to them um and uh in this case we're going to make a new one called active users we're still um going over uh users here uh and uh just like before but because we're adding these uh things to them we start with an empty dictionary and then we're just adding these um and you can do you could use a pend here um as well and especially if you were using a list you'd want to do that but you don't have to do with a a dictionary assignment of a new key which again the user is the key here um will will append it by default so um that's why that works uh quite nicely Ju Just a little uh I don't know oneoff I guess with uh using sequences is when when you're manipulating uh the sequence itself that you're you're working on it it's kind of a useful pattern um that uh was in the tutorial that I'm grabbing some of this code from um that I think is a great call out here and one of one of the uh things that can trip you up um if you haven't seen it so uh just want to put in your back pocket like oh yeah I kind of remember that when I'm iterating over things um that manipulating that thing itself uh is is not best practice making a copy and looking that up would be would be a good thing for you to remember so um anyway just a little oneof here hope the very short one let me know if you have any questions about this one though um certainly the code will be available for you there as well thanks
