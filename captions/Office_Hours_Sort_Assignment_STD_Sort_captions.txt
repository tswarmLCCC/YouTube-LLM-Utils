just outside of everything here make sure we're getting into the program always good to check sometimes right if it's our program yeah so I don't know why it's not printing this you might type in the M yeah I think you're right but it's not even letting me it's just hanging and let me try something else I've seen this before where it um and I've got I got another Visual Studio code thing going on over on the other side I was working on the C++ program so I'm going to actually close this just for a second reopen it check that out and you my geez I'm stupid it's just a dumb error on my part I didn't actually ever call the function so let's call this sorry this is what happens when you code in front of people you see what happened there b yeah yeah should work a little bit better so let's go and do that oh and then then of course we do have to um make this an input function just I just had it I just gave it a string there pretty silly mistake and then we do do we do need to make this an integer don't we yes because it needs to be a number to to do what we're trying to do um so I'll just copy this here better y so that'd be the idea and then of course you could Loop through in in our if statements you could write another while loop in here to do what you're doing bie which is validate the input and all of that kind of thing at that point you could also use a function by the way if you wanted to so you could write write a function to say you know do end and and make sure it handles it all in there make your code a little more readable and I know we haven't covered functions but might be something to think about you don't have to do it this week but would we get to functions in two weeks or a week and a half now you could think of oh that'd be good place to do that right where it makes it a little more readable instead of writing the same code over and over again but um yeah so that that's something you can certainly do there as well um so that's a way you can handle that menu system um and the different options of course you want you you'd want to do a little more clean up uh than what I did here very quickly and you would also probably want to write a little bit better messaging than I did here you guys do a lot better job than I do that when I'm doing demos um so that that that that'd be a way you could maybe maybe kind of handle that so hopefully that helps a little helps yeah great oh I did I did Rec that again
