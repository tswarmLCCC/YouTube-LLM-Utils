hello welcome to a special topics uh lecture that we're going to do um right now this is for computer science 1010 uh at LC but we might use this unit uh for other classes as well so I'm going to speak in more of a general term um there is an assignment uh for my 1010 class but um you might you might not need to do that if you're in another class your your instructor might might choose to use this or might not so um if they've chosen not to do that please just disregard the assignment part of this video um the general purpose though is to introduce generative AI um to to students that may not have encountered it before and and talk about a few things uh regarding its use and um the unit itself kind of covers you know how we might use it in a college setting you know with homework and and for research purposes and things like that um so uh this unit will have several different uh components when once I publish it um in my classes I I start off I I teach a synchronously so I start off with this kind of uh overview of the of the uh unit this is where you'll find your instructions on what to do um your learning objectives um this lecture will be linked here as well uh once I have it done I'll put it here um but there's some required readings from different things uh the first two right now there might be more by the time I publish this the first two um are about using uh how to site uh different generative Adis like chat gbt um in um in apa and MLA uh style so if you're using it to help with uh paper research or things like that or and you need you need to uh well you do need to site it um this is how to do that so there's some references here for you that and then um this is from nature magazine uh this is a really well researched and thought out article on prompt engineering prompt engineering is of course the way we instruct these large language models to kind of help us and we'll I'll do a little lecturing on that here in a bit as well U but it's a fairly short article that I thought was good required reading for this um and then lastly there's a uh at least one article on um kind of an uh a um an issue with a bias in AI in this case following a history of kind of um discrimination against certain minorities um in in the AI world uh for example you know everybody that U was doing well in one way or another was usually portrayed as white um uh and you saw very few minorities in those settings unless you specifically asked for it well Google kind of went too far the other way here and um and uh started to really push uh you know promoting um um you know different uh orientations of gender uh and and certainly different races in into places where they shouldn't be um and you can see how basically U we've got some social issues here is really what I wanted to illustrate with this article in this case uh if you Googled for example Nazi Germany uh in the 1940s uh it would depict uh perhaps you know uh folks uh that were African-American or Oriental as Nazis and of course we know historically that wasn't the case um so it overcompensated the other way um the whole point of that is just to kind of get some insight on how uh AI can lead us astray sometimes and to maybe question the results um so there there's a little uh that's not required reading for at least my class U but I thought it was an interesting article um that would would discuss that as well we might do a whole another unit on bias in AI in it's uh General forms but I wanted to at least introduce it here um and then for my classes at least there's two assignments the first is a discussion post of um picking a problem writing a prompt which we'll kind of go over here in a bit uh and using like gemini or co-pilot um and getting some help with it and then writing about your uh your problem and did um it basically say did was AI helpful and what kind of what kind of ramifications did you run into what did it did it show any any inaccuracies did it answer your question was it great did it go too far were there concerns with plagiarism all those kinds of things um and then there's a paper of U that's also um uh and this is more towards bias here um about the responsibility of using AI uh of doing a similar thing where you um uh you you you you prompt with some a Ai and then you write a paper about that that uh experience um a short paper you know one one or two pages for my class is more than sufficient um were there ethical issues raised and what did you think of that uh from you know where you sit there's no wrong answer here I just want your perspective on that so that's kind of the unit in the nutshell and then lastly I did include uh this helpful tutoring prompt this will be turned on and I'll I'll refer back to this when we into the generative AI thing but it's basically a a really well-crafted prompt um from our folks friend we have some uh great material from I think West Virginia University Western I always get it wrong where it's Western Michigan I think it's from Western Michigan this is a great prompt to to start off um chat GPT and turn it into essentially a really good tutor for you um if you're having trouble this this gets you started more than you know the The Prompt explain something to me like I'm 10 this this does a little bit more than that for us these things can be very powerful um so with that I'm going to go into a bit of a lecture here uh let's see here it is turn this into reading mode and I'm just going to give a little bit of background um in artificial intelligence and large language models um just to kind of demystify what this is and isn't um AI in general is kind of the practice in computer science and and now in data science and machine learning of trying to have a computer perform actions that um it that humans typically only could have done in the past um so uh you know examples of these would be like understanding language or understanding images or detecting when things are a little different um in different ways uh you can fake some of this with computer science but AI tries to do this automatically where it tries to learn um from existing patter patterns and and train a computer program to do this without a human explicitly programming it to do it um there's a whole bunch of field whole bunch of subfields in this field um and uh we we're certainly starting to bring some of those into our computer science curriculum if you're interested but machine learning um and deep learning are the two biggies um those power other things like computer vision and natural language programming um in machine learning you essentially take um data in whatever shape it might be and you basically train it to do a specific task or find patterns in data there's two kinds of machine learning out there um in in the general sense unsupervised and supervised learning in supervised learning we basically say okay here's some data and try to predict or build a model try to build a program that would uh describe if this data is describing um you know a class or another class so for example we might use height and weight and and um age we might that might be our data set and predict whether this is describing a male or a female where you know it might find the patterns of you know weight are a good way to do that but then also have to combine height you know in some ways you know I'm kind of short and chubby uh where height alone I guess I'm a female but by my my weight it knows I'm a I'm a I'm a man so at least given my age um uh bad example but that's kind of what machine learning tries to do where uh or I'm sorry supervised learning and so supervised learning just basically means we're giving the computer the answers and telling it to to build a system to predict those answers unsupervised learning by uh contrast means that we're trying to find patterns and data without regard to uh without regard to um knowing the answers so it might instead say hey I'm going to group a whole bunch of of these individuals with the similar height and weight in in this group um and a different group of individuals uh in this group with this different height and weight and it tries to separate these groups out into naturally occurring groups or things like that and you can also do some interesting things like that all of this is well beyond the scope of this but that's what kind of machine learning is deep learning on the other hand is a term you might hear a lot lately and this is using something called a neural network um which is basically a data structure in computer science that mimics the way our ner neurons in our brain connect to each other um we have neurons and tendron they're called I think they're called tendron I was uh I always get those mixed up but anyway we have basically um parts of our brain connected to other parts of our brain and the way we learn is those uh those connections change as we experience things and experience things like pain and love and and regret and success and all those things those things change as we age and grow that's how we learn and this is a mimic of that in a data structure so deep learning basically tries to take um what's called a neural network and build many many many many layers uh of that to maybe to start to understand things uh more and more completely than it's ever been able to do uh before these things are not new by the way they've been around for years um at least as long as I've been studying computer science which is going on 30 years now um what has changed are some innovation in two fronts three fronts really the capability of computers just in terms of memory and dis the capabilities of processing these things and training them faster and then also some clever algorithm designs that help uh uh piece together language a little bit better as inputs to these things um but again all this is just kind of General overview of what these things are um of what AI is um a lot of people think only like Chad GPT and and Gemini and and all of those things um and like the image generators R ai ai is much bigger than that those are part of AI um uh and as a matter of fact those are what's called narrow AI uh in general where they're designed for specific tasks what we're approaching here a little bit uh for the first time in in all of our in well in human history there's no way to not be dramatic about that but it's true we're starting to get closer to General AI where it's theoretical still but it might happen at least within maybe our students lifetimes uh where uh the uh the computer can generalize and solve almost any problem like a human could as opposed to specific tasks so the difference between General Ai and narrow AI is that General AI can take on any task in in the same way that a human might where narrow AI is kind of what we have now where it can only do certain things uh that humans might do like image recognition or or n natural language processing like like our Larch language models do uh I talked a little bit about this um but a subfield of machine learning and neural networks are what are called large language models um large language models um they they uh have ways to basically understand the nuances of a set um in a way that's never been possible before and because of that we can then use this huge amount of compute power that we have available in the cloud these days like at Microsoft and Google um to start to build what are very robust chat Bots where we can discuss things in way in these with these things in ways that have never been possible before um excuse me little water here at the end of the day the point point being though is that uh um that uh large language models are not the only thing that happen in AI as a matter of fact it's a very small part of what happens in artificial intelligence but it's been getting a lot of press and it's in the public eye right now because it's probably the most advanced version of AI or at least the most um applicable to Mo human behavior and this even started like you know what seven eight years ago with you know our Amazon Echo right they they they've done some other things and then lastly I just brought some other I wanted to highlight a few other things that are um that that uh AI is good at um and we might see some uh improvements in the near future um even right down the road from my office here we're starting to do things with robotics and things like that um at the manufacturing center but the rest of this uh discussion we'll be talking about generative AI the act of generating content from artificial intelligence and this is done in general by uh what are called Gans General adversarial networks or generative adversarial networks depending on uh which paper you read but I I usually try to think of them as general not generative but they are generative in in nature um what the way they work is essentially for example uh in a large language model you might have one uh neural network system deep Learning Network that its whole job is to build a a uh a response to a question that seems like it would be done by a human that's its whole job so when I say you know um give me a recipe for bread it would give me a recipe for bread well if it kicks out you know maybe the weather in in Taiwan instead then there's another Network that says hey you did this wrong I can tell you're a machine so this one's job is to generate human human interact like a human type of response this one's uh job is to punish the other one when it detects that it's wrong so this one classifies whether that one did a good job of its uh human you know text generation or image generation or whatever its job was this one is its job is to DET detect fakes and this one is to make fakes that this one can't detect so they fight with each other and that's how they've gotten so good so fast is basically they'll start to train each other by combating each other and that's where the adversarial Network part comes in um is is that's uh kind of how these things are built so when you hear things like all AI is only a bunch of if statements that's really not true um it's an overgeneralization um I mean it's technically true in the sense that anything in computer science is a series of if statements uh you know the same way video games are a series of if statements and the way that you're hearing my voice is a series of if statements but really there's um there's these things that understand uh both um you know the inputs being given to them but also being able to generate um content in much the same way our brains do they're very impressive it's very impressive technology um let's see yep that's kind of what I was talking here I'm just going to leave this up for a second as I read through it make sure I don't uh miss anything um the yeah you know I really don't want to go too far into this um other than you know this is generally how these these things work um you know you can certainly look up any of these terms if you'd like to really jump down there but you're getting into some computer science stuff that I really don't really want to uh you know pull this uh video into a longer video I really want to get into some demos here as well um but I did want to highlight a few uh uh ideas of prompt engineering so let's first Define prompt engineering I think I have a a yeah a prompt prompt engineering is the art and science uh and D science of crafting effective prompts prompts are basically what we tell a large language model to do um it's a query or an instruction that triggers a response from a large language model and prompt engineering is the way we shape these things you can think of it kind of the way we write a paper or the way we even converse with each other um uh but I really wanted to talk about some of the terms here and I'll come back to these slides but prompt AR in a nutshell um there's there's some basic things that you can really do to help get better information out of a large language model and the first is um so the the basic quer the the the the um the outside of my outline here is the idea and then this is an example of it so um you know I might want to know hey uh co-pilot write a query about why group work is important and it it'll will give me something about that but then what I can do to make it better is I can give it context and perspective I can say things like act like I'm an act like you're an experienced teacher speaking to freshman at uh Community College in Wyoming and it'll give you a bit better nuanced answer closer to what you want um and then you can give it constraints like things not to do uh make it engaging but smart um you can give it examples of say you know I've written this thing that I like use this examp example as it's as your format but write it about this other topic you can do that and we'll see some examples of that on an image generation prompt in just a little bit you can give it negative prompts negative prompts are part of your overall prompt where you tell it what not to do so um this is really happy uh or really happy this is really handy in image generation when you're writing an image generation prompt um you know if you're drawing a person it might draw a person with three legs we'll just tell it not to and all of a sudden doesn't do that anymore because it doesn't know that people don't have three legs uh necessarily it's they're getting better you know as they train them more and more but if you specifically tell it not to Chances Are it will try not to do that in the future so you can add more and more negative prompts and I'll give a few examples of that here in a bit too um specific Direction you can you know tell it where to look uh you look at research you know look at certain articles with these ones that are connected to the internet and you can obviously give it um your own expertise you know say you know make sure you cover these points or assume that the reader doesn't know this or does know this that kind of thing or you can give it very spe specific uh uh steps to work through a program um helpful with programming and uh Math assignments if you're if you're looking for help there you can say you know please explain this to me step by step or first start by you know breaking it down in the way that I know my teacher would and expl exp that to it you can do things like that um yeah so a little bit more applied stuff uh to that end I'm just going to leave this up for a bit um pause it if you need to I'm not going to read the whole thing to you this is also in the the paper I linked um I just wanted to highlight a few very useful things I found um for the deck here uh I really am a big um big fan of guiding the model to Solutions the context is a good one um it depends you know on the prompt for assigning characters and asking for multiple options uh I'm a huge proponent of giving examples especially when you can provide a picture and I'll give a really neat example of that as well uh here in a bit and then we started to talk about these what large language models and neural networks are these are just kind some kind of uh definitions that you might not be familiar with um I'm not going to read them to you please pause if you need to here um uh one one that I'd like to highlight here though are the biases uh in ai ai is only as good as the data it's trained on so if it's given you know uh te you know a text uh Corpus they're called a body of text that's not representative of certain you know types of viewpoints or even perspectives or even kinds of people um it won't have those it it's it's not some magic box where it goes out and you know represents you know every single person on the planet um it's only it's only used what is on the internet usually um and often even then uh sometimes it doesn't do a very good job of that so some things to be aware of as well there um just a few more here uh some hallucination stuff uh that's incorrect or misleading results generate generated by large language models be aware of that large language models should never be considered an expert they should be considered uh an assistant um I often use the term if I don't get back to it I'll drop it here for you I often use the uh the um kind of um uh I I think of it that it's like kind of a dumb intern right um it might do a pretty good job on 80% of your task if you give it very specific instructions but never let it just go without supervision um that is not something that I would recommend at all certainly verify any results especially if they're new to you and you haven't seen it uh do do your own research but it can be great for um getting you helping you along the way um and then lastly uh again from that same paper I just wanted to kind of um describe kind of what's out there in terms of the big models uh the major uh large language models um most people have heard of chat GPT that's a Microsoft product or well it's actually open AI used by Microsoft is true um and that one accepts text and image files now as does Gemini Gemini in the very recent past as of uh March 19th when I'm recording this 2024 uh was called Bard Bard Google bard they renamed Gemini and it can take image files as well uh Claude Is An Open Source One um as is uh llama I think is that true no Claud is not uh but um llama is those are open source ones that they're just uh they they have uh they're much smaller models um and I think that's all I had for the slide so I'm going to go into a browser here um and I'm going to start with this one this is uh again it's on this page right here so don't don't feel like you have to copy all of this it should be available to you um but let's go grab that one uh where' it go there it is so I'm going to copy this and I'm going to put it into co-pilot here so this is just cop pilot. microsoft.com and I'm going to paste it in and what it'll do is it basically um gives a lot of context uh for um tutoring it sets up the AI to be kind of in tutor mode and say tell me a bit about oh let's say what don't I understand that that a lot of people do here um trying trying not to out myself too bad is being naive as I am on some of the subjects on campus tell me tell me about cooking gumbo and we'll see here that um and I'll I'll uh um this is going to be a pretty good response anyway because these are things are pretty good but it really uh goes through and it's um uh you can you can kind of chain these things together and of course you some of these are upselling things on these modern ones but um it uh uh you know so it gives me an overview but it didn't really give me uh you know it says start by doing this you know things like that but I know there's more to it where I could ask Specific Instructions um another common prompt I'm just going to start a new one here uh let's see yep new topic um so I uh I I I've uh I used a a dieting app uh as part of my uh CrossFit workouts recently and um I have an image here of a diet that it was on where's it at it's in here um and it looks like let's see this so this is a picture from my phone I'll bring it over here on this uh make sure we can see that and uh so what this is a picture from my phone and what this app would do uh would um would uh it would basically uh tell me how much of each of these I would need to have in each of these five meals to stay healthy but also lose weight with the workouts I was doing that's kind of the point of this well the other thing uh but I stopped paying for this app it was like $15 a month um but it wouldn't tell you meal plans I could enter food into it and it would look up in a database to see how I was doing but instead I can do something like this let's see if I can get it in here yep so I can just drag that in now and you'll see it pop in there and I can say uh I can say something like this where um so this is giving context to the AI and I could say something like please use this image and build a meal for meal five for me so I'm not telling it the protein and the carbs and the uh fat or anything like that and let's see how it does I've really been impressed with this result because it can actually uh read the image here which gives uh you can do a lot of uh of uh context based on an image right it could be a picture of your family it could be um a picture of maybe a math homework problem and it could help you you know with that uh really just your your mind's kind of the uh your mind is kind of not limited by how you can describe things you know with words uh you can give it images so right now it's analyzing the image and it does take a little bit longer to analyze images but it does do a pretty good job uh let's give it just a second back here I might come back to it as well um and then we we could also try to do it with Gemini if we wanted to well what doing that I might go into one other example and use uh use um Gemini because I've got that open here um and I wanted to give an example let's see if if I have one still no I don't I'll have to open one from when I created some of my coursework earlier in the year so let me just grab one uh just grab this guy um did it start to come back I think it did give me let's go back well this did not do what I was hoping it would do it's actually creating images so I don't want it I didn't want an image so I'm going to re-upload the image too because it might forgot it might not know which image I'm talking about so I will um instead of having to give me pictures of images we need to give it more specific prompts me find my this guy again one second put it back in there [Music] um and just drag that in there as well so let's try that let that go for a little bit this is an interesting an example though of how it can get things out of context it just it didn't know if I wanted a meal or a image of a meal so hopefully this uh this will this specific uh clarification will give us a little bit better result um in the meantime though let me bring up that prompt again um and it has some nice examples of negative prompts let me find that uh let's see where' that go so when I was writing a bunch of stuff um I I went through let me see if I got a better example I kind of like this one but I I had a better one as well let me just sort by date here um when did I do that I had to write just a whole bunch of um that's not what I wanted either let's see I'll go ahead and do this one um I'm just going to look at one other no that's not what I wanted that's kind of the one we just that's that tutor prompt I was just sharing this is a good example I have some better ones I just don't know where I put them um where we give it a lot of context so I'm writing a prim style Prim is a computer science uh teaching style where you uh predict what's going to happen you investigate it you modify it and then you make it that's what Prim stands for so I'm having it write a lesson plan um uh for a community college uh you know providing code that I then review of course um uh um you know and then it didn't quite know exactly what Prim was so I wanted to make sure to reinforce that it should be made able to copy and paste because sometimes it wasn't doing a great job of that and then I in other versions I told it what not to do and then I gave it a specific topic because I WR wrote many of these this one's on object-oriented programming um and a subtopic getting familiar with python and the languages in python as opposed to like a different programming language and you can see that so basically what I would change is just this little bit I'd engineer this part as I saw bad results I'd give it a little more context and things but I would only Swap this out as I needed more and more uh information and I use this as a the starting point for a lot of well that's interesting I know it does this I'll try to do it in uh in Gemini here in a sec actually what I'll do is I'll do this one over here um so I just paste that whole prompt in and we'll let that get going and we'll try Gemini um let's see how it does with our image and it's important to know that there's multiple ones of these right uh because it can be it could be useful when you can't get results from one to try others now sometimes you can kind of talk uh copilot into or different ones into doing different things if you just prompt it differently so yeah but anyway here's our our Prim style so you know very basic text and again the only thing I was changing out was object-oriented programming here and the programming language so this does a pretty good job it it you know uh gives me a learning objectives some coding examples um and things I could build on now I could also say you know maybe describe some of these things but this is not a bad uh place to start and it generates a lot of content cont for me of course I'd want to run this code and verify that it's doing what I was expecting it to do um but uh there's a lot you can do with that um I had a better prompt and I I I I thought I'd copied it into this unit I apologize uh where it had some negative prompts where it said don't do this and don't do that because it was doing things like I remember one time Jim or Bard at the time when I was doing this in the fall was like Hey Buckaroo let's learn around about programming or something like that it was like really just silly um assuming the audience was like a I don't know 5-year-old kid so I told it specifically not to do that and then it stopped so let's see how oh yep so this is a great example again so here's the image uh here's the image and just by taking an image this is like I can't copy this text so it read the image and it figured out that for example in meal 5 I want 35 GRS of protein so on and so forth well it went out and it kind of uh figured some things out like that and I could even build build um uh you know an example of that so I could you know maybe copy this one and say okay meal for's coming up so I'm saying just give me a specific meal and shopping list for this this and it's giving me a shopping list I could pick this up on the way home and it says enjoy it's a protein bar okay and so maybe I don't like protein bars and I could say I don't like protein in bars and it'll substitute that out um which is just really just amazing stuff that you can interact with things like that so this one's going to be a hard boiled eggs with veggies and humus I'm not going to have this for dinner I'm actually going to eat out tonight but um it's really interesting how you can iterate from something as simple as a picture into something like that one last one that I wanted to show um which is a lot of fun it it's doing generative AI for images so um there is a web page out here in the world called hugging face and they are um it's a research uh page and you can um if you're a programmer you can actually download these models including like some of the gbts and things like that um and make your own local versions of these Way Beyond the scope of this but they also have these things called spaces where you can kind of play with different models so these are little like you can think of them as little computers on a cloud that people have set up to play with these things and I've got one here that does a generation so this is basically um a picture and I I'll go and swap it out here um just to kind of demo this I'm going to get rid of Einstein here and we'll grab we'll grab my ugly mug and and uh I downloaded um some an MP3 of uh the guy from pey blinders talking and let's grab some other text as well let's go grab my meal plan over here let's uh or my meal plan from here so let's do this instead of having it read peaky blender stuff let's have it read this meal plan to me and you'll see it's just silly um and I don't know if you'll be able to hear it or not but I'm going to go ahead and copy this out and replace the TT Tex here um and what this will do is take my image and use a voice from uh from the internet that I downloaded this is an MP3 and it's going to read this in that now I don't know if you'll be able to hear it but you'll be definitely be able to see the guy talk so o That's I actually need to generate it here so let's uh should be a a submit I need to hit submit so it's going to go out and this is going to take a bit um hopefully not too long um and I don't know if you'll be able to hear it uh I'm going to try to pick it up with my video here and let's go to here um and hopefully this doesn't take usually takes about a minute and it it won't even probably read all of this because it's limited we'd have to actually you know rent a computer that could do this uh from like Google or whatever if we wanted to do a whole bunch of this but uh hopefully you'll get to see my lips reading this or I could do something from pey blinders or the star spangle Banner um but it's in Tommy Shelby voice from peeky blinders I just happened to grab that one uh we were just watching that over the weekend um and so you won't hear my voice it's using it's impersonating that voice with this text and shoving it onto my face and doing some lip syncing so hopefully comes back before too long here usually it takes just a minute or two we'll see how long this goes and again this is a generative AI so what's happening here is there was a model built and these things get saved so it doesn't like retrain the model each time it it basically uh they'll spend just huge amounts of computing power to build a program that does this taking an image and and this text and and this voice and making something as hideous as this let's see how it option to cotage cheese with vegetabl R CLE EG cup L fat cottage cheese ke Swan cucumber sliced cup cherry tomatoes have per fresh herbs to off ches dough or parsley salt and pepper to taste injections C Lumes to Choy vegetables or and I can download this this this file to my computer if I wanted to um sorry for that nightmare fuel but you can kind of see that it it did exactly what we told it to do a complete you know not very good but complete deep fake in in like 30 seconds um and that's kind of the state-ofthe-art right now there's a lot of neat things out there for these things so um anyway uh I hope this has been kind of an interesting exploration of what these things are what they do some terminology some Theory um hopefully it wasn't too overwhelming for any of you and then if you're in my class uh please do the discussion post and the uh and the the pro the the discussion post in the paper um one about ethics and one about the uh the you know how you might use it um I'll probably add we have some uh material on ethics that I might supplement um on this if not if you have any questions please let me know if you're in my class thank you bye
