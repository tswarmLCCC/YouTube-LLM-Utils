welcome to the start of our introductory uh series on Python Programming um python is a programming language that is very diverse in its nature um and has a ton of features that we often don't get to see the ins and outs of uh if we study programming in general or we're just using it for a quick project and that that's the intent of this introductory uh series before we get into the language features and things like that although we'll we'll see that same theme throughout the uh the entire uh series of lectures here in 2409 um we're going to start at the very beginning um and talk about some of the highlevel uh features that python brings to us um that may not uh be apparent for um users that maybe came from 1010 for example or just have heard of python or things like that so let's start with what python is uh python is a programming language um a simple uh uh program language that's designed to be simple to use um at its core um and will allow uh with it's built with a lot of extensibility in mind you can build a lot of things on top of python which is kind of what it's most famous for and you can do it quite easily compared to other programming languages um the uh the main features that uh python brings over you know uh things like Java or C++ programs is that it brings in what are called High level data types to us out of the get right out the get-go as a matter of fact in the next video we'll we'll talk about uh strings and uh lists which are somewhat hard to do some of those features are hard to do in C++ and Java you have to do a lot of leg work before you can do things like dynamic memory or string indexing and things like that um the uh the Syntax for some um although not me uh is is a little bit simpler than C++ or Java where we use um a statement grouping is done by indexing instead of beginning and ending brackets um and the main thing that probably a lot of people that come from other programming languages um really enjoy or uh end up maybe it can be a pain is that there's no variable or argument uh declarations in Python um it basically uh the memory uh allocated is a um is is derived from the first type of object that is uh that is assigned to it um we'll study that in the next video when we talk about those types of objects in uh in um in a little more Earnest um so the uh the the first things I want to introduce um of course are the working environment that we'll start with we'll we we'll be building on this quite a bit um in you including using GitHub and a few other uh testing platforms um maybe we'll even get into make files here but um at its core python is just a program um and if you've got it installed this is not it this is just where I'm working right now this this directory here uh this is VSS code by the way um you can do this using vs code you can use it uh uh you can do it with a lot of online web editors including GitHub classroom which we'll probably be using at least for this next semester um or you can just use it from the command line and that's what I'll I'll demo here but python by itself when you install it is just a program um in this case uh installed on my computer is python it might be python 31 uh if you're using Macs or things like that um and this is being um referenced uh on my computer because it's on What's called the path the system path um basically uh on my C drive uh I can bring it up here actually let me go and do that um let me grab let me grab a window here uh this is not where I was at but you'll if you go here you'll see I've installed it in this python directory and I've actually got two different python directories installed I'm using python 39 here and you can see that there is a python executable here this python executable is what I'll be calling um the the structure of this thing this is where uh a lot of different U Libs lib and Libs for example are where uh other files go to support uh python when we bring them in and that's how we start to build things up uh but the the point is this lives on your computer somewhere and python itself is a program that references all these other things knows how to work with them and we'll cover that as we get to them um uh in this case I've installed it on C python python uh 39 which is a string I gave it during installation and that's actually covered uh in our installation video if you want to refer back to that um but the python executable itself is is what's called it's it's linked on what's called my path my system path and anywhere I'm on this computer um it will know how to reference this file it basically says okay I know to look in that directory but if you're if you've just seen python typed before or you've only worked in an IDE know that somewhere there's this kind of setup and usually it's linked to um with your operating system to know where that is at all times um so that that's an important bit about the infrastructure uh going back though let me go back to ID the IDE here um I can actually call this program uh from from here and you'll see I'm getting a python interpreter here um and that's what I see here it's python 3913 it's showing me the version and basically when it was built and things like that and if I pointed to the other one the 311 I'd see that there um and then I get these three little arrows here um those are basically saying I'm waiting for a python command so if I type you know hi it's going to throw an error we we'll see plenty of Errors trust me but if I did something that's valid like print high you'll see that it just comes out and does that um now I can do the same thing in a file um and that's what happens when I hit the uh run python file here so I've created a python script example file here and i' I've put um a command in here and uh and when I run that it does the same thing now um the IDE here the uh integrated development environment here will basically uh run this file for me uh and and pass it to the interpreter but it's still doing the same thing so uh you can actually do quite a bit let me go back to my first window you can do a quite a bit uh right here if I wanted to for example use this as a calculator I could or I could say uh you know I and I could assign variables and things like that that's what we're going to go into the next video uh but the last thing I do want to talk about is this idea um that uh you can um you can pass arguments into python code um we won't cover it directly yet but essentially um oh and the other thing I I do want to show let me let me exit out of python here is that I can call this script by passing the the file name into into um into python so you what you'll see here let me let me make this just a little bit bigger um so you can see the full thing here hopefully it fits oh it's behind my head let me move my head oops uh sorry sorry sorry sorry I'm messing up my whole video here let me move my head here um and what you uh let me let me just do this just for a sec what you'll see here is that let me go and close this because oh dang it um there we go um you I can run Python and run this python PR example and uh so it's taking the file as an argument to the Python program here and running hello world that's how that's working the other thing it can do is I could if written the program properly uh to take it I could actually run an argument to do something like this now this one doesn't do anything with that but it can take this word word high as an argument to your program and do something like that as well with it as well um and that's called the arguments list uh we'll cover that down the road but you can basically run things uh you can pass things into your python environment and your files as well there so anyway that's enough for this intro video on the environment um I'm going to go right into a similar video on typing and uh and and and we'll continue to use the console there uh in in the next video so look forward to that
