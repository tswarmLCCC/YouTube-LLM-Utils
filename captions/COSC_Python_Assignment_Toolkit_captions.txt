this video is going to go over how to um work with uh the python environment that we set up uh for this course and um and also walk us through how we would uh potentially download our assignments go through some lessons and you and then a few tricks in the uh Visual Studio code environment that will help us uh with our week to week uh work as we as we do assignments and and study uh some of the the uh additional resources outside of the um the zybooks environment so um in uh both shells uh this one happens to be in our 24 I'm sorry I'm in the wrong one um it's actually this one I wanted to bring up for 2409 here in in our shell here um both in there uh there's uh there will be a getting started um uh unit um as well up here that this will ultimately end up in we'll have this weekly assignment General instructions reference page um which is this page that I've built and I'll be working through in the first part of this video um the the idea here though is that we will be downloading a file um from a weekly module that will be our assignment and some supplementary material um downloading it to our computer moving it to a place a workplace that is uh useful and convenient um and to to work on the file um by itself so we don't confuse it with other files um doing some work in Visual Studio including our programming and then submitting the thing to back back to Canvas here so I can grade your work um so with that we'll get right into it um going back to 249 here um uh although this uh this doesn't need to necessarily be about 249 um this is our uh our python uh programming uh section um let's uh Let's Pretend We're in week three here got through some of the early setup weeks in the hello world type of program and we're uh going through and we're reading along that we have this homework assignment here so we can go into there I think yep I do have it open already um and it would look something like this um and uh it will have the instruction here that I will also put in the zip file we'll get back to that in just a second um but at the beginning of this you're going to uh have a file to download called a zip file and really all the zip file is I'm going to go and download it you can click this you can click the link all of those should work and you should see it download eventually like this and you can see I've done this as I set up for this video a couple times but I'll come back to that in in a second um the zip file is not nice because it it compresses a bunch of files into one file so you only have to download one thing but because of that we need to um basically take that download and unpack it and we'll go through that right now so um a couple ways in Windows or or Mac uh you can usually do it right in your browser you can usually click the download folder that it went to right like this and it will just open it so this is the file I just downloaded um and you can you could see that in that download downloads uh directory here um but you can open the folder there but even if you hadn't done that um you could also um go to your uh your downloads folder on your computer um and the way I do that is I use the the file explorer in Windows here to bring up one of these guys um these file explorers um uh or you could even do that you could type uh I think it's just Explorer yeah in in Windows to bring it up if you don't have it on your bookmark on your address bar like I do once you have that up you can go to your downloads folder and you can see uh the the file that you just downloaded now I want to emphasize this point I think it's a very bad idea to do your work in this folder um the reason is you'll be downloading multiple things here and doing it here you're going to overwrite things and things like that I recommend one of two approaches um either way is going to involve moving this file so I'm going to cut it here cut or copy either one will work I'm going to cut this one just CU I don't want it to remain here after I'm done um the the the way I'd recommend if you've got your One Drive set up is to use it um and I'd make maybe a folder called homework like this and then um maybe a class folder like this one called c249 and then um the if unit this is just a a name that I'm giving it for this this week week's homework you could call it you know week three you could call it um you know assignment three whatever you want just a place so when we add more and more of these you can keep them separate and then you can go in here I'm going to actually delete this stuff um because I impacted it earlier just to test it um and then because I've I've again I've got this uh I've got this file copied here and I'm going to just do that again and I go I can go back to there navigate through that whole structure home homework so you see that unit and then I'm going to paste it right so all we're doing is moving a file at this point um uh hopefully this will get you that far um and then in in both Mac and uh Windows you can actually just usually rightclick on these things and uh you can uh ZIP file it's got we've got built-in support to extract these things um and you can just use extract all to do that um you can also use a program called seven zip which makes it a little easier but that I'm not that I'm not going to go into all that so what you'd want to do is to open the thing and to extract all and it's just going to say do you want to put this here and I do I do want to put it here um so it's going to put it right in this file I can hit extract and it will give me the option to actually open this up after the fact I'm not going to actually do that because I've actually got the window right behind this and you can see what it does it basically takes this and creates a new folder with all of our stuff in it so that's how we unpack it that's how we get started right and there's a lot of files in here um there's two types of files I'm going to sort like this so I can keep them separate there's these the these MD files those are called markdown files and those have instructions in them I'll show you how to open those in just a sec and then we have some python files um that are basically here to to kind of act as our classroom environment in this asynchronous environment and I I'll go through this particular unit here presently um one way if you've done the setup uh where uh let's see where I suggested in the I'm going to go back to 1010 just for a sec because I haven't moved the the page over but if you've done this python set setup uh and done this part U this is something you should do in week one um if you've checked these open with code buttons like I suggest here you get a nice little mechanism in this uh file here where you can actually uh rightclick and do show more options sometimes it's buried but then you'll get this nice open with code button and I'm actually going to close my existing Visual Studio code file here and do exactly that just to show you how that works you can right click on it and you go uh show more options open with code and it will just open that directory right up in our in our Visual Studio code environment we've got all of those files right here if for examp if for some reason though you didn't do that you can also do file and you can go open um folder in or open folder I'm sorry yeah open folder is what we'd want and you could do the same thing where we would just point it at this at this folder uh here and select folder and it does the same thing so even if you didn't get that set up correctly you can do it this way so once we're into this thing um we we're going and I let me go back to the the canvas page because I I want to show you where you can come back and reference this thing uh let's see make sure I get the right directory apologies for that uh weekly assignment so basically what I've done so far is download the zip file I've extracted it in a folder and I kind of walked through that part here uh for your class and then talked about opening it open it in Visual Studio code um now I want to reference this Prim model it sounds kind of like an interesting accurate ASM stands for predict run investigate modify and make so of this uh these four options the four top things um those are going to be like our interactive lecture type of things they're optional but I recommend you do them especially if this is new material for you that week the make on the other hand is actually your assignment um and uh there there there's a usually starter code and a description to that end um this is actually what you're going to turn in though so that that's how to navigate that structure and um what you'll notice then is if I go back to visual studio code here we have files to that end so you might might remember predict and run are the first one so I have some python file here right um and then we've also got some instructions here the cool thing about the um instructions is you can open a preview so if you just open this it'll look a little you can read it certainly but it's actually a markdown file which means it's got some formatting to it and you can actually open the preview instead and you'll get a little bit nicer version of it um for the predict uh bit and you can actually move this over see how you can like drag and drop well I can make a new window over here so I have my instructions right here and then I can close this guy so like uh for example the predict part is basically your your job is to sorry I can't get those to close I'm just going to kill that window real quick um is to examine code and kind of run it and see if so this is fully working code and I'm going to give you a couple ways you can do this in uh in in in your python environment probably the best way for these um is uh if I've got multiple examples in in in in in a bit of code you could either delete part of it and run the whole file or what I like to do is you can highlight like this and then you can rightclick and use this interactive window you can also so you can just run this and what it does is it actually will fire that up as a bit of code oh I need to change sorry that that's my fault I uh you won't have to run run into that um I just need to change it over to U I was working in in a data science uh uh thing I just need to change it back so you'd highlight this you can rightclick it and do run in interactive window and what that'll do is it'll launch give me one sec I just need to reopen this I think because I started in the wrong dang environment give me one sec just to redo that um apologies for that so again show more options open with code right and then I'm going to just close that close that and we're going to open our predict file and then uh I'm going to make sure that yep that's set up correctly this time and I should be able to just run this guide now there we go so what it's doing here it's kind of mimicking what you'd see in an environment and but it's just running it here so this is the actual output you see I've actually asked it to do um it it it says can you guess what it is it's it actually put out both of these things and it's waiting for me to to do this input here you see so it says I thought of the number that's the print statement here that's what's going on here and then it's it's waiting for me to do this part and the these um these inputs are really what can kind of C get you caught up on the whole thing and I'll show you a few more versions of that in a second um um so in this case I'm going to go through this and say hm I see a a number very variable here um and I think this is a number guessing game and I'm going to guess because I can see the answer that it's seven and we can kind of look and examine what's going on here um the the really nice thing about Visual Studio code though is we can do things like breakpoints and things like that where we can uh we can run and debug these things uh right here in in the code itself and um and and it just learn a lot about what's going on as we go so it's doing the same thing um just down here in the console now uh where it's asking us a number down here and then it hits our breakpoint and you can see we get some really cool things here because we can get start to see our variable numbers and things like that so there's another way to do this kind of work where you're just exploring code that's all we're really doing here um we'll we'll get into the debugger another time maybe a little bit further in this video I'm not sure yet um another way you can do it I'm going to go and forget about this interactive window um and this is a bit tricky I want to just warn you uh uh the way the way these things are supposed to work I I'll just like delete this example but um you can actually just usually just run the whole file right that's how Python's kind of intended to be run so I could do this I could use this drop down and run python file and we get the same thing here we get that interactive game right um and then it goes back out to what's called our Powershell prompt um we can actually just run this from here we can um use the python command and do the same thing so if I go back to my file explorer over here like this I see this one's called predict. Pui I can run Python and I can give it the name of this this script and that's another way we can run it same way um but let me show you one thing that you could run into let's pretend you kind of got lost and you just wanted to to fire this off you could run this and you could go uh you could run this in the python terminal doing the same thing shift enter does that by default but what will happen there is it will try to basically take all of this text and just throw it into a python terminal because you can actually just run python like I can just do like this where I do like print hello right this is a perfectly valid command and you can actually use in a python like this but it's not very useful for programming because we can only do one line at a time like I could even do 1+ one and it will or one plus one Ed as a simple calculator well what this tries to do when I rightclick this and do um uh run selected lines in Python terminal it just takes this python code and just starts shoving it down into this thing and that's great most of the time but uh what happened here is we got to this input put statement and what this does is it basically waits for the user to give me an input in this case it's our guess that number right well what instead happens is it will it says okay I'm a dumb Python program and I'm going to run this code or shove this line down to here then I'm going to shove this line down to here it doesn't know where to stop um so what you could have done I'm going to clear this out you can do that usually with control well in this case I need to actually exit Python program um and then contrl L to clear clear it out um you can also just do that by by killing these if you want to and rerunning it um so what you can do if you want to use it this way is you can highlight the the code and go up to the input statement so like I I want to see what's going on so far so I can I can run this and after this time I'll use shift enter to do this because it's a little faster um so you can see that it pops it up and it does I've thought of that so that's the print statement and then what you can do is do the same thing and it will actually ask it for you but you don't want to go past here because if I went past here and went to here it's going to think if is the answer to my question and that's not what we want we want to actually answer it so that variable gets a value right and it stops because that's all that we've given it but now guest should have a the uh you know it's going to have that we've run that line we ran it right here we can even see what we ran right here and then we can send the rest of the code uh to it because there's no more input right it's actually just processing at this point so if I do this I can shift enter and it does it does solve the the problem um so those are several different ways um and again you can you can if you're if you've got these three lines uh that shows that you're in the python interactive uh window down here in the terminal um you can you can get out of that just by typing exit and you do need to put the the two um braces here or uh parentheses because that it's a function in Python saying okay I'm done I'm done with your you the python shell right now and then it goes back to our our prompt so that's what's going on down here I know that could be a bit confusing but I just wanted to cover what's going on so you have a way to kind of cope with what might be happening if things go south and you get all kinds of Errors because what can happen is like okay I just want to run this thing right I just hit play and I do this and okay seems to work oh it went up here I actually put the number up here right that these are all things that can happen as you're working through the thing or I might forget that I'm not in Python right now and I try to send the whole thing like we did just a little bit ago and it it'll blow up it's a bunch of Errors because What's Happening Here is it's trying to run python as a in in the as a Windows command right uh the this code it's like saying take this and just run it you know um where instead what we need to do here in this case because we're in the Powershell uh environment is we need to actually call the word python the the command python which calls our interpreter and then and then do the the program so again you can do it that way uh oops sorry um oh I just spelled it wrong there we go um same thing here but really um and the the the main thing I wanted I'm going to get get our code back for for the predict and modify and all that stuff I think the best way honestly is to do what I started with you highlight the thing you right click you go to this interactive window and it will um it will fire that up uh in in a new interactive window over here that's basically saying here's your print statement and then you answer up here so don't get confused that like you don't even need this at this point um don't get confused between that and the bottom thing because then you can play with it so when you're doing the explore and the modify things I really recommend you do this where you run this in the interactive window like so and it will you can you can see what the codee's doing there um uh so anyway so uh now that we've done the predict part I'm going to just pretend we've done that uh yeah we'll go and save it that's fine um so moving on from predict uh the next part is invest the investigate part we're going to open the preview again I'm going to grab the preview move it over to the side here like so and I've got some instructions for you again here um and I'll just close this guy out we don't need it anymore and we will grab the uh uh we don't want the preview one anymore so we want modify uh or I'm sorry investigate we want the investigate python code and we want the investigate instructions and and we will just preview that like so and then we'll move it over here to make our life a little easier and then we can have our code and our our uh uh example code going on um so it says use the comments I really don't care if you do that here you don't actually have to answer these down the road we might add quizzes for this stuff um we'll see how it goes but the idea is to investigate of uh you know um what's going on here there's just some questions here that I provided that'll help you kind of piece out what's going on so um what line does selection start on great question right well we know that we're we're selecting things in our number in our expression from our reading uh for this unit um would have been covered in the reading in the lecture video and so you know we'll just say okay it's six and how many are there well there's there's two right um actually or if you want to call else a statement three but either way you're just kind of mentally answering these things it's just something I would do in class if we were live um i' I'd ask you guys to do this and kind of see make sure we're understanding so this is a great time to go through this and just make sure you can answer these questions it's an even better time if you have a stumbling block to get a hold of me so do this early in the week right it's pretty simple stuff most of these will be like this um after you've done your reading it'd be a quick thing to fire up and get through and say okay I get it or I don't get it and I really want to get a hold of the professor in this case to answer these questions this is a great opportunity for that uh moving on from our investigate will we have modify PR r i right investigate and then M sorry I need to I need to kill this guy so I'm going to hit Escape just to get rid of that close out my window close that out um I'm going to grab our modify and our modify instructions open preview and I'm just going to move again this over here like so um this is where we start to change things um so we're going to add a line asking to add a third number so we might do that by like this right where we just start actually editing this thing and again this part's ungraded this is again for your understanding a third number right um and then um we might just run so the nice thing when I've only got one program in here here is you can actually just run this right you can do this absolutely down here but I prefer and this is my preference I prefer to do it like this um to just go to this interactive window and fire it off because it's a little bit nicer environment so it's basically running that stuff off and it's sitting here it does the bit it's got to this line right here you might even see it see how it's running it'll tell us that it's running and I can I can just put it it's asking me for this part so I can just pit three here and the nice thing about this that I really like for instruction um I'm going to just do all three of these prompts uh like that the really nice thing about this that I like for learning is you can see these variables so as I've entered these things you can go in and see what they are by using this variables button which I just think is amazing um I think it'd be really really handy and then we get our output just like we would expect so we can explore that and then to complete this we might do something like this if we go back to our instructions we see that it wants us to say is the third number bigger than the first and whether it's bigger or not than the second so really all we need to do to do that if you think about it so we take number three and we say is number three bigger than the first number and we'll just change our labeling and then we'll do the same thing with the second number so we'll say is number two bigger than number number three um so that's that's really what we're doing here is just modifying a few variables in this light exercise and we can do the same thing here and you could delete this if you wanted to another way you can um interact with these is you can actually comment out code uh which means to basically make the code inactive there's two ways to do that you can see actually um comments come from documentation like I I put in this word starter code just to give an idea of this is you know starting but this is not python code but it's in a Python program the way that works is if you start a program or a line of code with this pound sign it doesn't do anything with it it is just here for my understanding I can put anything here so the cool thing about that though right is we can do use this little trick called commenting out code to disable this first part if we just want to run the second part and then we could do exactly what we did before where it would just run um uh sorry what did I do there uh let's actually just run I'm going to close this down sometime and just run it in our we'll just run the python file there we go there it works works so it it's actually running the bottom part so I'll do that and I'll do that and a third number because we did that in this code and way it goes it works um so that's one way to do that as well um the other way to comment it out I'm just going to control Z to undo my work earlier is you can actually comment out multiple lines of code and this is the faster way to do it by using this syntax so what this is doing is basically taking three quote marks three single or double quotes doesn't matter but they have to match to open and close the area that you want to comment out or disable so you can do the same thing here if you want to run it at as the file at a time so if you like using this thing this is another way to do that um so after you've modified the the code there's one last thing to open and that's the instructions for the program which again uh uh uh is a markdown file so we can just do the same trick where we preview the thing open preview move that over here and then then if you've got starter code from me it'll be in make in this case we don't it's just a blank file and it's basically tasking you with writing uh to take user input and um do a lot of comparisons and print something out um and then there's you know just whatever I could think of to help you out I put in the instructions these are the same instructions by the way that will be in your assignment uh uh here um so that that's uh that's where those come from I just copy them from here and that's just for your convenience um so that's uh that's kind of it for uh what we'll be doing in Python until the point where you need to turn the thing in so when you get to that point I put a little blurb down here just saying you know maybe give you you might want to rename the main file to something a little more constructive so um I'm actually going to use this because it's week three um it's just an example uh and go back to visual studio and what I can do here is I can just rename this to something like that and make sure you get that and you can even see it it renamed up there so if I'd done all the work here that'd be ready and you can actually rightclick if you want to and open this in file explorer right here and then this this file this main what started out as your main file you'll know it because it'll be the file you're working on this would be what you turn in to Canvas down here um as part of the uh submission these are accepted these take uh file uploads so that's how you'll turn that in so that's kind of it um a lot a lot here but um I want I wanted to give you a kind of a this V uh page and video or this this page and video is kind of a uh a backbone to to kind of get you familiar with it uh and then have this as a reference if you ever kind of forget a few steps and some of the support that you have in your week toe files um I think this will work well for us but let me know if it doesn't um certainly early uh we'll do this as early as week one when we're doing our hello world program um so you'll have opportunity to get in there and kind of mess around and uh and see what works and doesn't work uh between the um the setup for the program or you know kind of going through the mechanics of of doing this work so do that early let me know if you have any problems and we'll we'll get you through that and get you to where you're familiar with kind of the tools that we'll be using to learn programming thank you
