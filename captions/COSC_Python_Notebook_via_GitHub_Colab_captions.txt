welcome back to our um instructional python series um and in particular uh you know kind of our setup videos um for the class um one thing uh that we will use a lot in this class just to simplify instruction is a technology called python notebooks um there's several different varieties of python notebooks out there um but all of them do kind of the same thing in in essence they let you run python code in line with uh what's called markdown which can um be used to uh just just write text to talk about output you can also do graphing um and some light interactive work in Python um and the cool thing about them is they work in a browser um you can use them in vs code um and probably code spaces although I haven't tested that yet um um as I experiment with those I will offer uh videos um on how to use things locally uh these things locally or um you know if you want to set up a a local server using python uh to run these notebooks you can as well but by far the easiest way to get started with python notebooks is to use a hosted environment online and that's what we'll talk about today in this video we will talk about using uh Google collaboratory or sometimes shortened to to Google collab um or Google uh Google Labs sometimes as well uh to uh view our notebooks in class it turns out this is super easy to do uh because I will set these up in in GitHub um so the short version of it is um if I send you a a lesson in um in Co example code um for example this is our computer science 249 class um uh for spring of 25 um in the functions unit you might see something like this there will be more here I'm working on this unit right now but there there might be more here and as I do lectures I basically put the code in the into these lesson docs folders um and so these are just markdown files you probably have seen these before um if you open these of course you can read them directly right like so um or if they happen to uh uh if you download them in um in uh uh vs code you might they might look like this they might look like this and you can right click on those uh in the tab and do uh um preview or view um and they will go back to their markdown format um and when I say markdown all it is is is that the same type of text but using uh some simple um encoding schemes we can do things like bold things put code in blocks where you can copy them and things like that uh notebooks take that idea a step further let's go back to this one where we get the same thing as a matter of fact I can go into these you can see that I'm using just pound signs to make a bold and you can put links in here and all of that um and uh so on and so forth but the the nice thing about them is you can run python code right in here so uh what you can do when you see a block like this is hit this play button like so and and you'll see um it it's it's the first time you run them it'll say you know this came from GitHub and I'll show you why it thinks it's from GitHub but it's for me so you'll be okay you can run it and it will start this spinning window here the first time you do it it will take a little bit to fire up the environment you can see it's initializing it um and you can see there that I get the output of this this code um and you can clear it um like so um and run it again um so on and so forth one thing about uh python in general or notebooks in general is um this will state you're using a terminal here uh and there's different versions of it uh don't know where it go I can't remember uh but there's a free version that will run almost all of our code at least in um our computer science classes when we get into AI we might have to set these things up on our local cluster and you might not want to use Google although Google gives you quite a few free resources you can even do some AI level stuff with what they give you for free if you try to do this um and you have not signed up for colab before uh or you don't have a Google account it will ask you to sign in you might notice that I'm signed in here um as me oops sorry my window got shrunk here let me just go to the right a little bit so you can see um that I'm signed in just on my Gmail account here um so that's an important important aspect of it all um is is that you'll need to sign in but that's okay um it doesn't do anything harmful and as a matter of fact you can even copy these and author these on your Google drive if you um want to use that um so that's the up upshot on how to use them uh but to open them there's a couple ways to do that um the first way um and I'll try to provide these you'll notice this link here um actually links to my GitHub I don't know if you can see the bottom there but in GitHub TLC uh basically that's a link that looks just like this in the in here and this will open directly in in Google collab so I can make links from my GitHub account uh the LC Version of me uh directly into collab and I'll try to provide those as we go but the other way you can do it um is uh you can go let's go into notebooks let's grab function Basics here or I'm sorry if if I go into the notebooks here this is where I've authored these things and I've got several ones um this is kind of a work in progress so it's a little little ugly but let's say I I was interested in function Basics here well what I can do is right click and I can just copy link address or I can go into this and uh just grab this whole URL here like like so right um and you'll get a preview here so if you don't aren't interested in running the code um GitHub classroom and GitHub in general will do a preview of the last state I left it in um so you can actually read it and see the code output here so if you're just trying to read it quickly you can you don't even have to leave GitHub um but if um but if you do want to run it um it's pretty easy to do you just go over to collab and you go file and you do open notebook and use GitHub here and then what what it'll try to do is try to guess what you want um I for for this purpose I would always just paste this full URL up here like so and then just hit search um so as soon as I do that I don't know why it's not letting me search I'm good just hit enter there yeah that's fine um you'll see that it opened there um let me try to do that again it was a little wonky there let's so if I put this in here and paste it you'll notice I've got the whole URL here and if I search that it will basically find that notebook now if I leave this off you'll see that I can see other notebooks in there which is kind of cool too um so a couple ways to get it and then you just open it and Away you go you can see that um it'll it'll set it up just like before and start running it give just a sec to do that now you can edit this code um so you can can certainly edit this like so and if I run this you can see that I'm changing the code uh much like I do in the lecture for this video um and if you want uh you can also save this you can save a copy of this where you go save a copy in drive or you can save a copy back to your uh your GitHub um i' I'd recommend starting with drive so as long as you've started signed up with Google you have 15 gigs of space for free um and you can just save it there now one thing you'll want to do is kind of pay attention to where goes and you can rename it by uh basically coming up here and just renaming it this is a local copy for you you can start it too if you want to find it quickly um and lastly if you don't know where it went you can go to that book and go locate and drive and you can see on my Google Drive here whenever it comes up it will show me where it is uh it looks like it's trying to do some stuff I my drive is kind of full I keep my personal photos and things like that there so I'm going to close this but that's um how you can navigate that so once again you you you can either if you see a collab link directly you can just click it if you're using a GitHub link you can copy and do file open notebook and then paste it into here or you can actually just upload the uh notebooks to to your um to your uh to your your your drive as well lots of ways to do it so um I think uh in the beginning parts of my courses I'll start with command lines and things like that um but uh as I do instru especially in Python um I might do less in vs code uh and More in in here just because it's easy for people most people to use just to follow along but I will show you um uh in another video how to set up U what's called Jupiter server so you can run this on your local machine if you choose to um but if you don't want to set up anything locally for a lot of our work you can work right in your browser here for uh following along the lecture material um you can do I'm I'm still considering whether I'll accept work this way or not uh but that that that's a that's a different discussion so for now uh this is mainly uh to be used for uh reading notebooks that I provide for instruction that I will use you know as part of the lecture so uh let me know if you have any questions um hopefully this is pro proves fruitful for you um I know I've sure sure enjoyed re uh I didn't know actually before uh yesterday that you could actually open directly from GitHub which opened up this window for us to uh do a lot more in without having to set up things locally let me know if you have any questions thanks bye
