continuing on from our introduction to the python environment um we're going to now jump into the building blocks of python uh programs themselves um those are basically numbers strings or text and what are called lists um and then we'll get into just a little bit about our first steps into into programming itself um but before we do that I want to talk about one other thing that you might see in some files which are called comments um this has to do with the structure of your program has nothing to do with your program itself um the uh so this here's an example program much like what we just did where we have a variable being assigned to one um and that there's a text variable being created with this string um and we'll talk about strings in just a sec uh but the other thing you'll see here in green um and it's only in green because my program here my integrated development environment knows that this is what's called a comment um comments are things that are ignored by the program they're there for your own documentation and I encourage you to use them quite a bit to help you keep things straight you can talk about why you're creating variables problems you're having with a pro program what an algorithm or a part of a program is doing and all kinds of things like that it's good for not only your own use but also other people coming be after you uh their use as well um sorry I'm losing a bit of my window let me resize this just a bit there we go um and let me go ahead and move my picture oops dang it I always do that let me move my picture back down here uh like so there we go sorry just my video editor here and while I'm at it I'm going to make this just a little bit bigger as well this this window sorry create putting code onto vide can be a bit challenging sometimes but anyway the idea here is that these comments don't do a dang thing other than help you um and you can create them two ways first is with a pound sign so any anything that starts with a pound sign is going to um is going to become a comment as a matter of fact I can even do it over existing code to disable it temporarily which is super handy if you've got problems with one line of code or a couple lines of code I can do this and it gets rid of it um so if I run this uh so if I run this uh program let's just scroll stinking video uh sorry there we go um if I run this now we'll see uh let me save it uh if I it will uh and I can print the text here uh or well here we'll do it like this we'll do print text like so um if I do this you'll see our output does uh it prints this is not a comment because it's inside quotes right um but if I comment this line out you'll see that when I run this the next time um that won't happen I'm going clear this just so we don't confuse the matter and you'll see that nothing happened it told me that it ran R the program but it didn't actually do anything um and that's what comments can do uh there's two kinds of comments like I was starting to say the first is by and you can comment one line out at a time by preface prefacing it with a pound sign the other way you can do it if you wanted to say I've got a multiple line comment um like so right how would I do that well one way of course is you could do this and then this but you can also use what's called a block quote is where you can put three tick signs before and after the thing um or is it pounds or I cannot remember how to do that oh no it's I was using the wrong ones that's all it is um where you can put uh the uh three different um three three single quotes is what these are um and it makes a block quote out of it now it turns out you can actually do similar things with strings where if you wanted multiple lines with strings but if you just use them byself by itself it will make a multi-line uh uh comment so uh you'll see here that this will actually run um after I and we we'll see our print statement come back um and but this does not trip up the program like it would if I did something like this uh so just and you'll see now that it's not a common it's trying to use this as a python uh uh uh command and it doesn't work right because there's multiple lines there so anyway two ways to do it you can uh use single single pound signs or multiple single quotes sorry I messed that up just a little bit ago um all right that's enough on comments but if you see those or and you should use them and I will expect those in some of your code um you'll see that in the rubric this is how you do that and I do expect you to comment on what you're doing within your code uh when you turn it into me so get in the habit of using those early and often
