okay picking right back up after our uh introduction to this shell I'm going to go over the syllabus which again is um almost exactly the same between uh my two python classes CC 1010 and 2409 I'm going to use 1010 here um the syllabus is pretty straightforward um and and covers a lot of stuff that's embedded in the Shell um it's just here written out in one one printable format so if the main reason we we do all of that is if if you ever have to go somewhere else and show what you did in this class this is a nice way to do that um so you know we've got basically the credit hours and the the title and all that stuff my contact information uh one thing I didn't mention in the previous video is I'm moving uh right now I'm up in the business building BT uh uh which is uh on the south side of Campus um I'm moving over to ARP next year to 161 um so if you if you had me previously and you're looking for me I'm over in ARP now where Monica Wilson used to sit in the math area um so uh but other than that come see me whenever you want that's just fine um if you're going to contact me uh through email please just put COC 1010 or 2409 in there it helps me uh quickly figure out which shell to navigate to and find out what material you might be referencing and U you know I have about 80 or 90 students most semesters so um I can't keep all of the what classes you're in straight especially at the beginning of the semester so please do me that favor um I've got some dates in here we start on August 19th we end on December 13th um there's some other days in there but the main thing is uh like I said at the be end of that last class is make sure you do that introductory quiz in the canvas module by August 19th it's right there it's called you know uh startup quiz or something to that and I think I've got it right here it's called week one quiz this one says 20 2023 it'll say 2024 by the time you see it um so please make sure that you absolutely get that done so you don't get dropped I had two students get dropped last year and one of um wanted to be in the class and they were just on vacation so um that's your responsibility uh to make sure that gets done and if you don't get it done you will be dropped um there's some other dates in here uh talking about the last day to get 100% refund uh on your transcript things like that uh make sure you're aware of those um especially if you start to fall behind and and and you want to maybe uh get out of the class um certainly uh important dates there uh we have the course description and competencies in here um really this is mainly uh for you if you need to transfer this is all embedded in your work uh but this will be this is a general overview of what you'll be doing so make sure to get familiar with it and then uh the this is a required uh textbook uh make sure you get it through the LC bookstore um and uh in week one I or week one or week two I think it's week one even there's there's a a required reading there um that you need to do it's its own own whole category so make sure you don't neglect those um you're you're required to do those and there's um there's little uh self checks and things like that in there that will um help you reinforce what you're you're doing every week this again like I I said in the previous video it it's meant to um it's meant to kind of mimic what what we would do in a live classroom setting if it was a required uh inperson attendance class the course competencies again this is kind of for transfer purposes uh make sure making sure that people understand what you are learning in this class uh nothing too crazy there um the attendance and drop policy uh this is not a a this is not a class where you have to be in class um your attendance is graded two ways your discussion post and your zybooks learning make sure you do those every week they are automatically well zybooks is automatically graded and I'll grade your um discussion posts every week your discussion posts you'll have uh one discussion uh due by Wednesday evening and I'll just check the due date the date on that and make sure it's not just um you know hey me too that kind of post those you won't get full points for those um and then make sure you respond to one other student's posts every week this is uh just like every other online class pretty much um my dates are Wednesday and Friday evening all your stuff is due Friday evening by the way in my class including your your graded work uh so anyway this is the policy for non-attendance things like that uh we don't cancel classes it's an asynchronous class it's online um if there's 40,000 fet of snow out there uh we're still going to have class um you know we might not not do our office hours or something that week if if it's really a disaster and internet's out or something like that but this material is online for you anytime and you're expected to do it the grading scale is pretty straightforward um there's four categories your weekly work is 30% um it's uh it's 30% of your grade that's that week toe Prim stuff that I talked about in the introductory video um and then you have your uh what will probably be a midterm and a final in this class both classes um although I might get rid of the midterm anyway the entire uh the entire category is worth 30 % of your grade so your graded work and your midterm are 60% of your grade cumulatively and then the other uh 40% is divided between your discussions at 20% and then your uh guided learning that automatically scored uh uh you know participation grade so lots of free points here take advantage of them it will keep you afloat um if you do the work in this class you should be just fine it's it's really it's really not that that bad of a class um the grading scales very typical uh 0 to 59 F and then 10 you know 10 points each for DC b and a respectively um we have a very nice um uh you know uh uh course management system in canvas where you can access your grades anytime you can see exactly what's going on and if you have questions come see me um I've made a few mistakes not too many um I typically grade very quickly but uh you know bed a few exceptions and uating circumstances you should have um very quick feedback on your on your work um and uh the idea there is that we discuss it early and often I I believe in um open dialogue about grades and progress and things like that and course correction I don't expect you to just Master computer science by reading a book uh and not have questions and and uh that's why I'm here um please let me help you do this so don't don't just live in in a cave and and never come up from Air just because it's a a this class I believe in open dialogue and and working with you to to fix things um so um I don't accept late work um uh you know uh typically um make sure you get those in um the reason is I want to talk about the homework after it's turned in with the whole class and say this went well this didn't well well well I can't do that I can't talk about the solutions if some students have don't have things turned in so please please get things turned in on time um that said if there's if you're going to be out of town if you've Fallen ill if you have family problems let me know um I will accept uh I I don't I should I shouldn't have said I don't accept late work I do uh I do accept late work if you let me know ahead of time or very close to when it's due um just just you know it's real life Ju Just talk to me about it that's all I ask is um don't just don't just completely ghost me and not turn something in and then five weeks later you know turn in and expect credit because that's not fair to the people that did it on time so if you talk to me though early we can certainly uh accommodate uh anything that's coming up uh things like that so I didn't mean to say I don't accept late work I don't accept late work without prior without prior authorization is a better way to say that uh let's see just typical stuff on audit policies and things like please go through this uh so you understand ramifications of incomplete grades and things like that the ability to audit cheating the only thing I'll say about cheating is don't do it I don't mind if you work together or or work with your classmates a little bit um I I do believe in collaboration and certainly with me but your work needs to be your own I need that to be an artifact of what you know so I can demonstrate that you understand this uh to you know uh other universities uh or or uh or even my own classes down the road this is kind of our promise right that we make that says this is how we know that we understand this thing so don't cheat don't cheat it's not going to do you any good um you can use AI in my class I I I actually believe in it I teach AI uh as well here um and uh I'll even show you how to use AI for coding if you'd like um happy to do that um we even have a unit on it in computer science 1010 um but don't don't over rely on it it will write your whole program I know what those look like though so don't like I I know I used AI plenty and I've I've written plenty of computer SS and I'm going to I I keep a pretty good tab on where each student is at you know in their programming ability so if you make you know a jump from I can't quite get a program to work at all to writing a whole game we're gonna have a talk and it won't be a fun one so don't do that to you or me okay um you know if I if I detect cheating it will be a zero and we'll have all of the full ramifications as outlined in the in the course thing so you can use AI use it as a tool to help you write your own programs do not write the whole program with AI I'll say that one more time you can use AI as a tool to help you write your own programs and understand facilitate understanding but if you run into something that AI is doing and you don't understand it come talk to me that's why I'm here the our job is to help you understand this stuff not to teach you how to use AI to write it that said we'd be silly not to right so you can use AI to help you you and remind you syntax and say hey this isn't working can you help me all that's above board but you need to be able to defend your work that's all I ask uh um certainly uh uh student rights responsibilities diversity all of that accommodations um our uh Osa uh office of student uh what's it accommodations that's what that stands for is great they they they're they they're great they work great with me I'm happy to do anything I can to make the learning environment um as conducive as I need and we've also got some great tutoring I just wanted to highlight some of that stuff available here on campus um if you fall behind that said please don't feel like you need to use the tutors you can come to me too so um other than that I think we're just general yeah this is just general stuff uh for the college so nothing new there but please go through the whole syllabus uh as soon as you can so I think that's everything I had for this week one uh introductory stuff I just wanted to uh make sure you are uh aware of the ins and outs of the syllabus what they mean and also how to navigate the classes please let me know if you have any questions thank you bye
