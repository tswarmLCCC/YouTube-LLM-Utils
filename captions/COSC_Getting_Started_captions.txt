hello and welcome to class uh this is a general video uh getting started uh with um our two python classes computer science 1010 and uh 2409 they're very similar classes and and and the syllabus and everything are very very similar um the they they did differ in their curriculum um so I'm going to actually probably just build one video uh for both of the Python classes here um introducing the the course structure and repet and how to how to get things going here in week one this is uh intended to be a video you watched very early in the class um and uh to help you navigate essentially uh canvas and a few other resources uh to get you going um early on and then we'll go through the syllabus here so um just because it says uh COC 1010 um I might use this for 249 as well uh so disregard that uh all of the all of the uh information here is exactly the same between the two classes um so the homepage here uh has a few features that I I want to um uh start with uh then we'll jump into the syllabus which is of course linked on our new tier one uh uh canvas uh navigational style but you can always get to the the current version of the syllabus here um I've got a downloaded version in word uh but it looks like this uh and you can download exactly the same syllabus I'm going to be referencing here uh from from that link um and then there's a little bit of information in here and it links the uh the assignments and things like that uh this will change a little bit as I update things through the summer here but uh that there's a good overview of the class right here um as much as as uh as as we could put into the syllabus here um and then the other thing I wanted to make you aware of on this homepage is this course overview page I think I've got a loaded here but I'm going to reload it this is a uh a kind of a sister page to the syllabus and one I absolutely recommend you go through um there's a bit of an introduction here and then I go through and talk about um essentially how to navigate the class which is in essence this video as well um where we talk about this homepage um I uh here I want I do want to mention that I use announcements quite frequently those will go if you haven't taken an asynchronous class here at a uh L C those will go to your email box so keep an eye on that but you can also navigate the get those uh from up here so these will be left over from the last time I taught this class but I will I I send these out about every week so keep an eye on those as well um you're responsible to keep up on that information um that's how I I notify you of uh any changes to the class as we need to during the the semester um how things are going uh you know any any any optional sync sessions things like that um uh the modules uh are uh the main navigational structure of the class you can get to those on the right side here or the left side here um directly and they look like this or in this new format you can actually uh use this ribbon format here these are the modules on this homepage so if you go home or you just go to the the front page like this any way you want to do it um these are the modules and they update as well so again this is specific to 1010 right now but the the python stuff will be uh or the 249 will stuff will be uh uh in the same vein there so um that's how those work um the main one uh in as you're as you're watching this video to immediately go into is getting started module one in getting started um is uh and and both module one and week one I should say but the main one to start with is getting started um and go through all of these these are all here because they need to be I didn't just write these uh for fun no these are things that uh uh that you'll need to know about out and and be familiar with to to have success in this class A lot of it's just administrative stuff like this one is using our repet environment repet is an online programming environment uh that we we use in a browser this is a very uh detailed uh explanation of that and how you will turn in your homework um setting it up and things like that uh um and then we we go through um again just a little bit of week toe stuff here start up um this is this is that same page um and oops sorry um and then this video uh will be placed here I'm replacing the video from from Spring right now that's what this video will be so uh hopefully you're you're F finding this video from there but I'll probably link it in an announcement uh this is actually no longer relevant I'm going to actually disable that that came from uh when we used uh Visual Studio code um for our python work but we're going to use repet going forward um then I uh this weekly um schedule and tips for success and in general instructions are very big ones to uh read through make sure you don't have any questions about those uh or make sure you ask me questions if you have them is a better way to say that uh but basically what this is saying is we have four kinds of activities in most weeks uh you're going to have a a reading which is an online resource called zybooks um so you'll need to purchase that through the LC bookstore get a code get set up those are linked to my class and you get points for reading them so make sure you do that and if you have any questions of whether it's working or not let me know and I'll check I'll check your grades or you can too um and you should see uh progress on those so zybook readings are are due almost every single week um those are called guided learning um in in your weekly uh in your weekly um in your week toe work so for example in this unit this guided learning would link to to zybooks and what they look like is is like they look like like this um what it's uh so it'll go go into zybooks and do all stuff that does the linking and and things like that and uh and you'll go in and for example in this one you do uh branching right so you go through these and you just do some reading and do some built-in activities that's why we use them is uh essentially this is replacing your lecture um or at least part of your lecture that I would do uh to cover our our general material this this is your primary instruction this is your textbook and there are activities in here that I would have you do in a classroom if we were in campus but you're not in a classroom you're at home or you're working you know wherever you are and uh this is this is this is replacing that part of your participation so this that's why it's graded and you are to do this every week make sure you do it some students have not done it and it's put them behind and some students uh needed those points to to to pass and and one didn't unfortunately so don't don't make that mistake please uh take the zybooks learning seriously um let me go back to our homepage here uh back to where we were um in this uh getting started module the other one is uh oh going back to that so that's the zybooks the guided learning that's what's going on here um and then there's discussion boards each week um these are very typical canvas discussion boards um almost every week we'll have a prompt and what I expect when there is a prompt to do that week is the week it's due not so if it's two-e unit you don't have to do it both weeks but most weeks are onewe unit you need to do the initial post by Wednesday evening um so you need to come up with your own original response to the prompt that I ask you and that's one of your posts and then you're required to do another one by Friday evening which is a response to somebody else's post and that's the interactivity part of that's the other part of your participation grade so make sure you do that uh please don't neglect those Stu some students do uh don't fall into that trap and then we have two different kinds of um uh of assignments um well I guess I really just one but um there there's two kinds of of of assignments there's um there's going to be a bunch of lectures um that I record like this in this format um under under each week so I'll show you kind of what those look like here uh uh and let me just find one that's open we'll just go into a module so those uh those are under this week overview so make sure you go into these unit overviews every week make sure you do that and you click in there and there will be some uh either linked videos directly or um or uh so they'll either be linked like this or I'm starting to refresh this course and actually have the the window right here so hopefully by the time fall rolls around those will be ready but they're YouTube videos they're YouTube videos welcome to the unit and what I'm going to try to do is break these up so they're shorter and you can have smaller ones to digest but there's a decent amount of material in here I go over the homework I go over the the unit material and things like that that's my primary need lecture to you every week so make sure you do that um a lot of materials covered in there um those are required as well and then lastly you have assignments um and I have a page in here on the weekly assignments as well um both in terms of using repet and following along what's called uh the prim exercises pimm let's see where's that uh weekly assignment General instructions here it is so those are basically um and and this will be replaced with the prim Prim uh material but uh you'll you'll you'll have access to files these are guided learning type of files these a lot of this is code this is code and I I describe in the weekly overview videos um and you'll go through and uh uh I use this word Prim P RIMM it stands for predict run investigate make and modify p r mm where some of it you're just examining code that is um reflective of that week's material and just seeing it work that's all you're doing you're just running it seeing it works and then you start to modify it and play with it a little bit and see what it can and can't do um inide Ed Fashions and then we kind of use this term gradual release of responsibility where I'm going to basically build scaffolded uh a code that does less and less for you and you need to do more and more so you're adapting this code to to to facilitate your understanding so um that's part of your homework that's that part is not turned in except for the last one the last one is called the make part PR mm predict run investigate modify and then make and the make part is what you're going to turn in so the idea is that I build you up over those five or more examples and and we go through those in the lectures and then the make part is what you what you change uh and uh and turn in for for your weekly work um and that's that a little different than what we do for the final uh we we there's a little bit more to be done there uh but that that's kind of what a typical week looks like where you do the required guided learning zybooks you do your discussion post you do the prim examples and then you turn in your homework so you basically have four things to do every week um and uh again sometimes there's two week units and then lastly um there's a a link here about me which is just a little bio um but also how to get a hold of me um through my email things like that nothing big there just part of required and then uh this last page is the last one I want to introduce you to in this video um which is basically uh how we how we do our office hours um office hours are live um and last year I did them two times or three times a week um I did them in two afternoons on uh Tuesday and Thursday uh is that true Tuesday and Wednesday that should say Tuesday and Wednesday uh sorry I had a typo in there all year apparently last year um Tuesday and Wednesday we did them in the afternoons and then Thursday morning we did them in the morning um for two hours and I do two things there um I often will just fire up my camera and if there's nobody here I'll just fire up my camera and sit here and wait for you to yell at me on office teams uh which the link is right here uh so you can click on teams and I'll you just say hey I need help and I'll be glad to help you you can also set up private appointments if you need to if there's something sensitive um uh or anything to that end if I can if I can I like to record those and post them for other students to use but sometimes I can't get away with that so some I don't do that it just depends on the material um and then the other thing we do is if we got a bunch of students um and and you guys want me to go over something I'll go grab a classroom and I'll I'll set up the the hybrid stuff in there and and and we can do you can you can come live too and we can go grab a classroom and work through any issues you have and sometimes we uh when we're ahead we play play with other technology is mainly AI I I love playing with AI these days so please come by I really enjoy uh working live with students uh our computer science classes here at l c are asynchronous but you're more than welcome to come come uh come be be in a classroom if you want to be it's not required at all don't don't take it don't take that to mean that these things are required because they're not uh but you're more than welcome to come get help at any office hour or even outside of that I I'm very liberal with my time with students I I enjoy working with students and frankly want to deliver as much in person as I can so please take advantage of that and get a hold of me um uh either uh on teams or or just come see me that's perfectly fine too so um I think that's everything in terms of the Corell um you know get right in do all of the getting started stuff and then absolutely start with week one there's lectures in week one here um where we we talk about a lot of the same stuff I was just talking about but the main thing you absolutely need to know and I'll try to hit this again in the syllabus link uh talk that I'm about already give make sure you do this week one quiz it's required and if you don't do it you're going to get dropped from the class so I think we start on a Tuesday in the fall and if it's not done by that Friday you're out of the class um that's a a a college rule not mine um it's something we do to protect your you financially uh if you accidentally enrolled for a class and uh before we really get into a lot of the content delivery you get a full refund is why they do it but if you don't if you don't show me any participation by that Friday they will drop you from the class so um get a hold of me and make sure you do that week one quiz that first week um that that that's why we ramp up pretty fast so make sure you do that week one quiz the first week thank you bye
