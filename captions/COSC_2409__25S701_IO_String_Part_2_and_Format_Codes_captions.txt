welcome back to our uh small little uh unit on string formatting um well this will be a big of a part a bigger unit on um input and output in general uh but uh we wanted to start with string formatting just to get away from straightup print functions um in in their default formats um but we're actually going to come back to that so we've covered uh the F strings formatted strings um and the format function of strings or or different objects um but you don't always need those those are really handy for when you really want to control the display but if you just want a representation or or getting some information out of of python we can of course use our print function there's two really cool ways to do that um the the first um is uh of course our print uh statement uh as such uh let me uh sorry bringing up my notes here um one sec sorry I'm jumping around a little bit uh where was that there we go um so uh there's there's actually two ways to do this the one you've seen before uh is probably the string function so there's there's usually two methods um you can convert any string uh any value to a string by essentially uh do what we call casting you've seen this before of course when we wanted to um add numbers that were stored to Strings we converted them to integers with the int function well Str Str is a built-in type uh in in Python uh called called the string uh object or the string class and we can make string objects by passing that uh into there there's another one out there though called re uh which actually stands for representation and they they work they they do similar things but they work slightly differently um you'll notice here that this basically just gives us a string in single quotes um but the other one uh gives us uh double quotes within strings there and there's a reason for that um the uh re the representation is meant to generate representations which can be read by The Interpreter basically you can you can pass this to the python interpreter if we were using it um as opposed to uh as as opposed to you know the single quote that we see here um many objects don't have um uh uh the uh so I guess we're getting we got we're kind of getting into a cart and horse problem here when I say class and object you can build um and we'll see this in the next unit probably object-oriented programming we can build complex types where we might have nested lists and like for example you might have you know a class of an employee where your first name might be Trevor and your last name might be swarm uh but you might have a a list in there saying how many you know what days did he show up right so you know on November 1 he might have been present and on November 2N might be absent we could store that in a list or a dictionary right um well as as you can as you can imagine if if we comine multiple dimensionalities of uh of of variables uh in this complex data type we can't just print them all out that'd be kind of wonky but well you can but you'd want to control that and that's what um the string method or the re the representation method of that object would do for us um so uh that that's kind of it in a nutshell there's we we've got a bit of an example a few examples here but um the main the main point is that uh we can combine things with rpr this is a great way to do what we call serialize uh objects but we'll see a better way uh in in upcoming unit on Json the Json the JavaScript markup or object or uh notation um uh but you can see that we we can get a string out here that we could store on disk or or print out just to see what the values are if you were for example working on a loop and you had these values uh as variables that were updating and you wanted a concise way to print them out you could just print out a representation of X and Y which are of course natives here these are just integers um and then uh then we get a uh a tuple here of spam and eggs um and and get all of that represented just in one uh one representation of our data type uh let's see just a few more examples um of course here uh we're we're actually adding a bit of a string to it um uh but you know um and using a concatenation function the the plus uh here is a concatenation function this is kind of the old style School of of of building strings where we' concatenate things together as opposed to putting them in Brackets uh as we would see with f strings and things of that ilk um and then uh oh one other note yeah that's why I built this is that uh when you have uh things like new line characters uh so back slash is uh you know new lines things like that the uh the string version of that will not print those out it will actually print the new line but the representation the re function does so just be aware that that's a that's there uh I think this is just a rehash of what I had above yep and uh some more formatting stuff that you can do on those uh again position positional arguments uh um and I think this is actually just uh we're I'm getting into Mark uh oh there there's our there's our our stinking percentage from above let me go and move that up there just for you guys we talked about it earlier uh let's see where was that at I think it was just oops I think I went too far uh let's see yeah there we go this is supposed to go with this uh so what was happening here is essentially we're formatting a bunch of numbers right uh getting yes notes vote no votes and percentage and then we're able to kick out kind of a nice way to uh to um you know demonstr rate what those look like um this is the formatting uh option uh that basically truncates that to nine digits is what's going on there but we can see we get yes votes and um uh and uh and get a nice formatting formatted percentage with two point2 decimal points the last thing I wanted to share um and I think it'll work um uh I put the link in here if nothing else of all the formatting options that I talked about in the last video not all of them but there's a he of a lot of them let's see if my video will play nice with me here uh but just know that there's a whole heck of a lot of formatting options uh in Python that you can bring up um and certainly look them up yourself I'm just trying to find the link here give me one sec to bring that up oh goodness there it is print F style string formatting yep so there's a whole heck of a page oh cool it did work let me let me uh let me get this fitted on here just for us just so you can kind of see what I'm talking about uh and format you like so um so if you go through here you'll just see all of these options that you can do so here's the single side decimal that we talked about earlier just all of these uh options for formatting different types um so you can see it's more than just numbers you can format bytes you can um do all kinds of padding um so this is basically the uh the the whole list of of string formatting options that you can have at your disposal uh we could write several videos on this alone I'm not going to of course I think that'd be Overkill but know that this exists this is right in the notebook for the uh lesson this week right here so if I'm previewing this uh let's just do let's save you um it's it's just simply right here um but there's many many other places where this is copyed around the internet I think this documentation is actually installed with python if you choose that option during your installation so you might even have it on your local computer if you need to find it in a pinch all right that kind of does it for uh string formatting hopefully this open your eyes the of you know into that world of just all the different things uh you can do with uh uh formatting strings and getting in and out of of of strings in different ways uh ways to represent objects and things like that um in our next series of videos we will be talking about um uh file operations uh including using what's called Json to uh write these to diss so not only can we format our output nicely we can use these formats to start to carry data around uh which is quite nice as well and then we'll we'll end up with a a a short uh little lesson on logging as well which I'm pretty excited about so uh stay tuned for that uh but let me know if you have any questions on string formatting um this has been a bit of a deep dive kind kind of a rapid fire one I think you've seen most of these I hope you have by now um you know in your studies but if if this is forign you know I went pretty fast on this because it's it's hard to say you know we format the string this way and that way and this way uh let me know if I I went to a little little fast on this um uh certainly you know get a hold of me in that regard so uh but all this code will be available in in plenty more uh for string formatting um so anyway we we'll move on to files now thanks
