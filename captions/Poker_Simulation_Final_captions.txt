okay let's introduce the final project for 2030 um this assignment um is a bit of a a software design Challenge and there's some um interesting implementations of data structures and uh things like that but you won't really have to draw on everything we've covered in class so much as to just Implement a few ideas solidly in C++ um the idea of the pro project um as you can read here is to essentially write a poker hand simulator so in this we're going to take a uh um a deck of 52 cards um and and model that so we'll model a card um a deck of cards and then a card of five uh I'm sorry a hand of five cards that are drawn from that deck randomly um and and and we're going to basically write a series of um methods to evaluate you know whether it's a pair three of a kind a full house etc etc um that that's the nature of what we'll do and then what we'll uh do from there is use object-oriented programming to uh stand all of that up and then run run through the drawing of a hand five 500 5,000 or even a 100,00 times to see what the odds of different um different hands being drawn naturally just in the first five five uh cards drawn will give us um so how do we do that um well that that's up to you right but um a a few things that um I'll be looking for um are uh um some object-oriented uh um Concepts we're going to build probably three classes um we we'll build a card class which of course will store our suit and the face of the card then we'll build a deck of those cards um and we'll probably have some methods in there to do things like shuffling and drawing and things like that um and and handling all the logistics that go into something like that and then we'll have a hand which is kind of like a deck uh except it only holds five cards and they're drawn from the deck the difference between the hand and the deck though is the hand will also have some methods that will help us evaluate whether the hand has a pair or two pair Full House and whatnot um and then from there you'll just write a simple main program that will um iterate through that whole process of drawing a hand evaluating and then we'll start counting how many of each kind of hand we have so that's kind of it um and then you'll just output you know out of how many hands that you drew how many were of each kind um and then I'll Supply a a file um that will give you the theoretical odds based on statistics and we'll see if we get in the ballpark um we'll uh we'll be discussing this um project throughout the throughout the whole course so that's why I'm linking it early here um and and and designing some of it together um in a group but you'll implement it yourself that that's a key thing here and you'll just implement it and rep it uh just like you will do for all of your assignments um but we we'll have some discussion items uh when the appropriate uh topics come up on what we might add to our our poker project so uh that's kind of the overview and what we'll be working for for the whole uh whole semester here um and uh I think that's all I have to say about the overall project um and obviously I can't start sharing code like we normally do cuz would give it away wouldn't it so let me know if you have any questions about it and uh look forward to discussing this interesting problem with you
