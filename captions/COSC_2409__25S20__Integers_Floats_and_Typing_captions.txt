getting into programming itself um there's three main building blocks in Python that we should start with I mean there's a lot of ways you can start um we even talked about Boolean values but um in the next series of videos we're going to talk about numbers and their operations strings and their operations and then uh what are called lists or collections of items um we're going to start with numbers in this video uh so uh of course a number or uh be represented in both an integer format so I'm going to go back into our python uh uh interpreter here so if I just use the word two that expression and I'll come back to that term in a sec uh just inter uh comes out as two it's basically saying what is the value of two um not very useful by itself right but I can start to use what are called operations um and these look a lot like what you'd put in a calculator this uh plus sign here is an operator it basically says do something with these two uh uh variables or or uh Expressions uh that we know our numbers so in this case it will do the addition operation as you might expect we have the addition operation we have the subtraction operation we have the multiplication operation and we have the division operation all built in just like you would expect on a calculator there are many others um uh a couple that are very handy to know are the uh the um the uh um uh Power operator the uh so that's not 2 * 2 that's actually 2 to the 2 this is 2 to the 3 you'll see that that goes to eight um there as opposed to this which would be six right so this one is multiplication this one is two to the raised to the power of three um of course I can also do things like uh put things in parentheses to have them um evaluated in order um uh and uh and so on and so forth just just like you had expected math um refer to the python documentation on all the different operators that are there but the main thing to know about this is that we're dealing with in this case whole numbers and we call these whole numbers integers um the reason that they're whole numbers is only because I only gave them um a number without a decimal as as I mentioned in the previous video I could do something like this and turn these into what are called floating Point numbers uh where they have decimal and you'll see the output changes um the the the uh the nine when I raised basically 3 to the power of three um it changed to 9.0 and this is because it's storing it as a different data type here um not to be confused they're both numbers and you can do similar operations on both and as a matter of fact python handles that very well for us much better than other programming languages but uh the um the operation is different because it the the way floating Point decimals are handled in the computer are are quite a bit different as well it's very very important when you're dealing with things like files or user input to differentiate between numbers and strings um so going back to just our basic example 2+ 2 right this works because they the it knows that uh when I just give it a a digit by itself or a series of digits it could certainly be like this um it it knows that those are numbers uh because uh of just just the convention but um if I there's not a lot between different between two uh this and this except that when I put things in quotes and we'll see this in the next video much more explicitly um they become what are called strings or characters this is not 21 the number this is 21 the string um as in like uh you it might as well be the word uh for for for what we're doing it might as well be 21 right and this operation does actually well actually you'll see here that in this case it does give us um a problem between the two um it's basically saying this operator plus it doesn't know how to operate between an integer and a string um and that's because I put it in quotes um you'll see here uh that one's explicit but I could do this and we'll see the same thing now it turns out I can convert between these things I can actually do this which is a function which we'll come to much later down the line and it will take a string and try to convert it back to a number so you can see that we can change change it back into a number and it will do the work for us um so just a little bit on the difference between numbers and strings there of course we can use variables so if I did something like width I wanted to to store something I can say the width is four and I can say what is the width times five this works just fine and we'll get 20 I could even do two of these and I could do width times height so on and so forth right uh pretty simple stuff there um let's see oh but one thing you cannot do is you got to actually Define these things so if I did something like width times depth it gives it says or I'm sorry spelled width there that's where that air came from that was not the intent there but you'll see depth is not defined because I've never defined it um so you need to make sure that you actually create these things before you use them um uh or you'll get basically this object not uh defined air um let's see so the uh you can um you can have a floating Point integers uh and a bunch of different things there uh let's see is there anything else I want to to cover um one one kind of interesting thing about python is that uh or the python interpreter basically you know what we're doing down here is you can get the last thing that was printed uh uh with the um underscore so if I just type underscore you'll see that it's 25 so I could actually do something like this 2 plus underscore and you could actually kind of build that you know thing we do on the calculator where you keep adding things up um that doesn't work in Python programs but it does in the interactive text uh so you can uh if you're using it um interactively you can certainly do something like that which is pretty pretty slick in its own right okay I think that's all I wanted to cover about numbers uh certainly in your reading uh or any online reference you'll see all of the different operations you can do with math uh but I don't want to beat a dead horse it's a pretty boring subject but I want really wanted to hit the uh hit the point between strings numbers here and then how to how to perform those operations uh in the in the environment here so that's enough on numbers for this introductory unit
