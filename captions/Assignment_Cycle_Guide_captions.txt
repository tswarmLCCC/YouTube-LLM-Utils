in this video I'm going to go over essentially what it will be like to do most of the at least the first part of the homework for the course the first SE uh quarter the first half of the semester um uh and how you'll work with python um and submit your files and things like that um so you'll notice in this getting started section which might if it's if it's collapsed just expand it um there's this weekly assignment General instructions video here uh it looks like this and it's basically what I'm going to go over here uh I'll demo this and and then I'll post this back to the uh week one um learning here in this week one overview section um as I'm recording this right now it won't be here uh but I'll link it down here if you ever need to come back and this is right next to our python setup uh page in video that uh you'll be going through in week one as well um so uh if if you but if you can't find that I I'll link it uh as well right here in this weekly SCH I'm sorry weekly assignment General instructions um so let's pretend that we're in the going through the course and we're going along here and we're we're in module let's say I don't know three um because I know there's an assignment there I was just working on a little bit ago and you open it up and you see something like this you'd see much less than this it'll be at the top of your screen um but we'll have this this uh this assignment here called uh I I if statement uh expression unit homework um that will be required for that week so if you click into that you're going to get a page that looks like this um as as we noted earlier I I used I had these Linked In replit and I've just cross these out right now because I'm hoping it comes back but this might not be here by the time you see it uh but what you'll do is um you'll you'll go over the instructions here uh which are again copied in several different places um but uh you'll you'll download this ZIP file uh ZIP is just a way if you're not familiar of packaging a bunch of files together and making them smaller so there's several files in there but this makes it so you only have to download one thing and we'll explain what to do with that in just a sec so go ahead and download that and it'll go down to your down it'll go when you click this it will go to your your downloads folder this is in Chrome but other browsers have similar functions and uh you can either click this or um if if you don't know exactly where that win or you lost it you could go do something like this um in Windows where you go into your downloads and it comes it'll usually be at the top like this and what you'll want to do is copy and paste this file um you can either right click and go copy uh or cut like this or you can go copy either one of these um I'm going to cut this and then what you'll want to do is find a place to do your work do not work in your download directory it will make your life just all kinds of chaotic um what I'd recommend is at the very least go into your documents folder here and let's just make a homework folder so we're going to make a new folder like this and we'll call it homework like that and go into there and it's a blank folder right and because you might have other computer science classes or other classes that you want to put in here let's go and make CC 1010 like this and then let's go ahead and make another folder called week three this might seem like a lot of Overkill but you'll appreciate this as you go when we start adding week four and five and final project and Midterm project and all that where you can keep all of these separate it becomes very handy to have a structure like this now I I'd already copied this but if you hadn't you can go back to downloads over here and grab the thing and copy it like I said or cut it cut it'll actually move it out of here and go into that that uh documents homework all the way down into here and then we paste it here we want to paste it here and that will make a copy now uh modern operating systems have a way of un unpacking this um so you can usually just right click on this thing and do extract all and it'll prompt you to say do you want to basically extract that here and go ahead and say yes that's exactly what we want it to do so when you do that it'll open it up by default and you'll have all this stuff that I I've uh i' I've kind of opened up for you here um that's the the the first key thing you're going to be doing is working on these files um now there's a lot in here um but I'll explain what's going on in just a sec um so once you've done that uh you can either just go to visual studio code like this and uh go file and you can go open folder like this and you can browse to there so again that's in documents homework all the way down to week three and then when we click that we'll just say select folder yep and that's okay what it's asking me is if I want to get rid or save what I already had here and I'm just going to save it so then you'll notice everything and you'll get this a lot um as long as you've downloaded it from um when you get this uh inv Visual Studio code you can um you can say yes I trust the authors uh from LC when you've downloaded it from there um it's just a warning that comes because of you know potential uh um programs that are out to get you but the these certainly aren't that so um I'm going to actually close this for a sec we'll come back here but I want to reference a few other things in this so this is kind of what I just went through and doing all of the extraction another place if you're using it and I do recommend using it if you have the option is to use your drive folder instead um this happens to be what mine looks like and I keep things like uh my classwork in here for different classes um but you could just set up a homework folder in here as well just as long as you remember where it is and where you're working from that's the key thing it doesn't have to be in documents but I would absolutely not work on your desktop or in the downloads folder that's going to make your life just a lot more complicated than it needs to be so either one drive or your documents folder would be a great recommendation for that the nice thing about one drive is it's backed up so if your computer crashes you can get your work back that's a big benefit of that and I can help you with that or perhaps the help desk the LC help desk they're more than willing to help you set that up as well it's it's the recommended way to manage your school work um anyway moving on um if uh and we've already done this where we did open folder but another way to to to kind of do that same operation we did just did is uh the one cool thing is if you'd selected the open with code option when we set up visual studio code you can actually just rightclick here and sometimes you have to show more options you can actually just do open with code and it does the same bang thing which is just awesome makes it so much easier than having to go through all the menus um so uh with that I want to introduce a methodology that we're going to use uh for kind of guiding our technical work in in our computer science it's called the prim method here I'm going to take one one drink real quick um Prim stands for predict run investigate modify and then finally make the first four of these in any of my my my courses will be optional these are for your learning these will uh complement what you've read in the Z books um and you'll do some of that there as well this is just kind of one more way I can I can give you another opportunity to play with some code um and we'll go through that individually here and then make the make file though the very last one is actually what you're going to turn in so for this if statement uh uh uh unit that we'll get to in week three what that would look like back in Visual Studio code here is uh vs code go uh I always lose that icon there it is um so you'll notice we have the same things over here so we're going to start with predict the P is for predict so I'm going to open predict instructions here and you this might uh this is called markdown and you can actually kind of make it prettier by opening preview or hitting control shift V I wrote These so you they're a little formatted so basically um uh it's it's telling you that this task contains clot examples you're going to look at them study them and predict what it'll do so on and so forth so that's it you don't even actually do anything here you just open this thing out up and it says number equals seven I've thought of a number you know I'm reading this code and kind of thinking to myself what do I think's going to happen when this runs what happens when I get to this line is this even going to run at all excuse me these files are completely for you to play with um you can delete an example I'm I'm going to happen to cut this or you know just block this out for a little bit where I I can use what's called an inline code or comment inline comment to comment this out so I only run one thing at a time like this and then I can actually run this so I think that it's going to assign the number seven to this variable called number then it's going to I think it's going to print this out and then I know just because I've worked with python a little bit that it's going to ask me for something called input where it accepts something from the keyboard so I'm guessing that this is a guess the number program big surprise right and I think I know what the answer is so I'm going to go ahead and run this like we talked about before where I hit the play button here and sure enough it does this print job and and it's kind of and I know this is a little pedantic and I'm sorry for dragging you along with this the point though is I'm saying this out loud because I want you to kind of think like this as we get into more complicated things where I'm reading the code kind of understanding what's going on and then playing with it a little bit um that that's the whole point of the predict thing um I'm going to go ahead and hit contrl Z or contrl C here to get out of this thing uh because I think I've kind of proven the point of what we're what we're doing here and then I'll clean that out you by the way if you if you're oh my goodness this is all Godly go uh contrl L will uh basically clean that up for you uh bring you back to a clean screen handy tool there so the next one is uh predict predict and run PR now we're into the I the investigate bit and there's investigate instructions same way you can preview them the same way um and it gives you some things to kind of look for uh make sure that there's some kind of gotas that I've written down in here or actually blatantly stolen from an online resource because these were much better than what I had um and uh but some things to think about so again this is all optional but if you're struggling it's worth it to go through this this will slow you down and really break things down to common things that happen and then we can go into our investigate pey program and it's basically going to do the same thing where you're going to answer some questions instead so these are guided you don't have to turn this in um if you have questions about it though please call me uh or got get a hold of me I'm happy to go through this with you this is exactly what this is for this is just a way where I could do something that I was going to do in class or would have done in a face-to-face format online for you um you don't need to you don't you know none of this is graded or anything we we'll get to that in a sec so that's investigate and then the last one is modify uh modify again has its instructions and again you can you can uh make it prettier by doing the preview and we're going to add a line to enter a third number for this assignment so that's the the M the first M of p r mm right um and then and then again there's more more more gchas and just supporting stuff here from this this material and then we'll open the modify file and uh I can't exactly remember off the top of my head what it asked me to do so asking to enter a third number so we'll add one more elf statement to do El statement sorry elf it's almost Christmas time um so we can say uh let's say maybe number three equals in input print a third number and then it's going to ask whether it's doing just a lot of el else if so we go in and say uh did it want I just to do it in line yeah so we we're going to do basically the same exact thing and say if number three is bigger than number two and if number three it's bigger than number one that's kind of it again so we're adding another part to our program and just really copy pasting code which is super handy thing to get used to doing um and then we can go ahead and run this and this is our first kind of fora so let's make our first number two and our next one nine and our middle one five so uh let's say uh did we do it right let's find out uh our first number uh was bigger our first number I think I said was was four and that is bigger than one uh and our second number or two second number so nine was bigger than both it worked let's go try it again let's go ahead and do something a little different let's say our first number was one our second number was let's say oh I messed up my prr a little bit that's okay so what I didn't do I basically made this the same same thing twice oh no it was number one in five so uh but I I I I didn't didn't do a good job with with my um uh oh yeah number two number one and number two so we did the right thing I'm sorry I I kind of got talking and and coding at the same time so that's the idea for the modify this is where you going to get to play with some code mess some things up like what happens when I do this oh no it blows up right kind of experienced this before uh we learn that we can hover over things and read some kind of a cryptic line saying it's unterminated what do you mean it's unterminated well in this case it means we need a quote to both both separate the uh the the English code away from our computer code um and it needs to be matching so we need a opening and a closing quote to do that that's what that terminated thing means in this case and then fin finally we get to the real homework and there's instructions So the instructions themselves are basically going to tell us what we want to do for this week these are what's going to be graded and they are also what are on the uh assignment so this is the same stuff right same stuff I gave you here is just copied in this instructions file that'll be there every week um basically giving you the uh the requirements for your program and again again because it's a markdown file MD up here markdown you can preview it and uh it will tell you what you need to do and again I've added some stuff down here to make it kind of nice for you to you know give you some things to think about now the make file though uh the make is blank this is up to you to write right this is where you get to do your work and show me what you know and uh and that's how we'll do this thing called grading you're learning this week um this is kind of the culmination of the week um on top of your activities and uh this is what you'll turn in so you'll turn it into make file um so let's let's just say uh you know print I did this very fast Mr Mr swarm what do you think right something like that so I save this now I know make is my file now what I'd like you to do then is to go to your directory your working directory here and that's in our our file and we have this file that we just changed right it's 3177 on my clock right here so this is what you'll submit so what you would do then um I'm going to I'm going to actually parse my screen here so we can get a canvas up over here as well is you'll go down to uh I might need to go into a student view for this give me one sec I hope this works yeah I can't submit it yet um unfortunately to show you how to do that but basically I've set it up to let you submit a file upload and that's what you'll do and then I'll download it and grade it now it'd be it'd be handy for me if instead of make you rename this to make underscore like CC and 10 Trevor swarm that did help me keep them straight right um and actually I might I might um I might make a note of that in the in the uh assignments themselves that's a good idea I think I'll suggest that just to help me keep what's straight and you'll know what your output is um so that's kind of it that's kind of what a weekly uh assignment programming assignment cycle will look like um please go and do that right now with the that week one now some of these won't have the full Prim stuff like the the uh the week one is just hello world right we're just kicking out a program that works you'll still submit it download it all that the same way um but you'll just submit it uh without all of the investigative stuff that really gets in into play like weeks three through like eight when we're going through the core of what we're going to learn about python in this semester so that's kind of it let me know if you have any questions as always um and good luck
