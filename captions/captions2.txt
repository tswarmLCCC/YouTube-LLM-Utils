1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:05,359
hello um in this video I'd like to go

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:09,120
over how to navigate most of your

3
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:10,639
assignments and use a webbased um

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:13,679
development environment we're going to

5
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:16,279
use in this um course called repet this

6
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:18,400
replaces using um integrated develop

7
00:00:16,279 --> 00:00:22,240
environments if you've used them before

8
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:24,199
and should simplify our grading and um

9
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:26,119
grading process but also how how I can

10
00:00:24,199 --> 00:00:29,279
help you if you run in run into

11
00:00:26,119 --> 00:00:31,920
something so if you're looking at canvas

12
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:34,320
and you're for example navigating say

13
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:37,000
week three here you'll notice that in

14
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,719
your assignment here um you'll have a

15
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,640
guided learning um and that's just the

16
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:44,520
reading from our zy books um and then

17
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:46,879
you also have a a graded assignment most

18
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:48,760
weeks if you click into that it will

19
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:52,399
look like this and it'll give you

20
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:55,600
basically some um uh information about

21
00:00:52,399 --> 00:01:00,120
the actual um assignment and then it'll

22
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:02,440
have this repet repository link um and

23
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:05,960
if I clicked this it would look like

24
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:08,560
this to me I'm sorry it looks like this

25
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:11,159
to me for example this is a Hello World

26
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:13,000
example um but this is the solution for

27
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:14,920
the instructor so it'll look a little

28
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,320
different um for you it'll look more

29
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:20,840
like

30
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:24,000
this um if you went directly to hello

31
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:26,320
world here and it might spin up let

32
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,040
while and say navigating if if the if

33
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:30,280
the if repet has been updated and things

34
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:32,240
like that but it'll look a lot like this

35
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:34,520
this sort of structure and what you have

36
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:36,159
here is a code navigation window and

37
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:38,479
then kind of a tool window but you can

38
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:40,640
put these anywhere um often when you

39
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:42,520
come in this one's pretty generic but

40
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,880
that your assignments will usually have

41
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:46,320
the instructions copied here as well and

42
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,799
I usually put them in the comments as

43
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:50,000
well although you should change those

44
00:01:47,799 --> 00:01:53,360
comments to do your own documentation as

45
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,399
you implement your work um but you can

46
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:57,600
for example put this over here or you

47
00:01:55,399 --> 00:01:58,799
can put the shell over here you can

48
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,920
basically do whatever you want you can

49
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:02,479
even put them down here if you like um

50
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:06,039
things like that so you can navigate

51
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:08,520
things quite nicely that way um and the

52
00:02:06,039 --> 00:02:11,360
really nice thing about repet um let's

53
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:13,680
see if I can um kind of demonstrate this

54
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,120
is it's basically a collaborative

55
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,840
environment that's kind of how it got it

56
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:20,080
start but um they decided to make a

57
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:22,680
version for educators which can be very

58
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,239
very nice so let's uh pretend you for

59
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:26,959
example didn't know how to spell Hello

60
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:29,319
World in your very first program and you

61
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:33,080
wanted to get help you could highlight

62
00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:35,080
the code here and go into threads down

63
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:38,680
here start thread and it's going to

64
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:39,959
basically pop this thing up and say um

65
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:44,239
what do you want to say about this and

66
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:46,319
say I don't know how to spell hello

67
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:48,599
which is silly of course but um you can

68
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:51,200
get help for anything like that and it

69
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:53,319
will it will start that now this is tarm

70
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:55,959
me as a test student but let me show you

71
00:02:53,319 --> 00:02:56,959
what that looks like on my end if I get

72
00:02:55,959 --> 00:03:00,360
um a

73
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:02,680
notification um back uh where' It Go let

74
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:06,440
back here and see so I get a

75
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:09,959
notification here that um that a student

76
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:13,319
left me um a comment and I can actually

77
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:15,920
click the thing and it'll load on my

78
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:21,560
end and uh you can see there that it

79
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:24,080
popped up and it um it uh it will let me

80
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:26,280
um you know I can I can review the

81
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:29,239
comment things like that so if I I

82
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:31,000
wanted to do that um I can I can review

83
00:03:29,239 --> 00:03:33,239
things like that and I can also just

84
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,120
bring up um and so can you bring up

85
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:37,480
threads so in here I can see that I

86
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:41,319
don't know how to spell so I can just

87
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:44,040
click this and say it's

88
00:03:41,319 --> 00:03:45,640
spelled hello so you can get a lot of

89
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:47,799
help that way and I can even resolve it

90
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:50,480
right here or so can you um so if I

91
00:03:47,799 --> 00:03:53,120
resolve this and we went back over as to

92
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:54,879
my St test student you'll see that it

93
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,799
popped up here and said he said

94
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:59,280
something but you might not and you

95
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:01,480
you'll get a notification but if you if

96
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:04,439
you can't find that again you can use

97
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:06,959
these same tools down here uh to grab

98
00:04:04,439 --> 00:04:09,360
the threads tool and just bring that or

99
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:13,640
let's put it down here even and you can

100
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:16,880
see that it was closed um but you can do

101
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:19,079
uh view the the resolved ones and you

102
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:22,199
can say

103
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:23,400
um um you know it's it's spelled hello

104
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:27,560
you can see what I said there and things

105
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:29,960
like that um which is uh oops sorry

106
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:32,000
didn't mean to click that so that's how

107
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:35,039
you can get help with this thing but the

108
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,800
really nice things about this um so say

109
00:04:35,039 --> 00:04:38,680
you're you're not you're not struggling

110
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:41,400
and you just want to run this thing for

111
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:44,800
most programs you can just hit run um

112
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:48,800
and it'll it'll look for main here um

113
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:51,039
and try to uh essentially execute um the

114
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:53,759
main main program in C++ it just knows

115
00:04:51,039 --> 00:04:55,759
how to do that um but as we get a little

116
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:57,440
more complex that might not work out so

117
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:58,880
great so you might want to compile it

118
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,800
yourself and this will especially be

119
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:02,840
true if we're starting to use multiple

120
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,600
files and headers and things like that

121
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:09,639
so if you wanted to do that you can use

122
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:12,880
the g++ command like this and I actually

123
00:05:09,639 --> 00:05:14,880
included that in in this one um oh wait

124
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:17,120
no that's sorry that's that's machine

125
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:20,039
code I made all call copied into the

126
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:22,960
shell Force before the the um the class

127
00:05:20,039 --> 00:05:26,479
starts so you can use g++ and all that

128
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:29,080
is is the gnu the open source C compiler

129
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:31,080
and Linker and what you can do then is

130
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:34,720
just give it the name of the file you

131
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:36,960
want to run or or compile I'm sorry and

132
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:40,319
we'll see over here that it's going to

133
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:42,600
kick out an a.out file um because this

134
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:43,840
is a Linux environment this is actually

135
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:46,680
executable this would be like an

136
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:48,199
executable in Windows and the exe file

137
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:50,199
but here it's a. out and you can

138
00:05:48,199 --> 00:05:54,120
actually run it

139
00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:56,639
um and you uh like like so and you'll

140
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:58,440
want to give it this uh uh period

141
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:00,280
forward slash if you're unfamiliar with

142
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:02,520
Linux this basically says say run in the

143
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:06,560
current directory I think it works

144
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:09,479
though even if you don't do that um nope

145
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:12,720
it didn't so make sure you put the

146
00:06:09,479 --> 00:06:13,759
the a.out um and you'll notice here if I

147
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:17,560
change

148
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:20,240
this like so and save it um this is

149
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:21,919
still going to just say hello world as

150
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:24,639
we would expect right because we haven't

151
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:27,199
recompiled it we haven't um made new

152
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:28,560
machine code from our source but if I

153
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:30,560
and you can just use the arrow keys

154
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:33,240
that's all I'm doing here you can rerun

155
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:35,120
this and then do a. out and you can see

156
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:37,440
it's it's changed right so that's how

157
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:39,960
you can do that um I'm going to go back

158
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:44,000
out to our team here and show you a

159
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:44,000
slightly different version of

160
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:52,240
this and show you how you might do this

161
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:54,400
uh with a uh multiple multiple files so

162
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:56,000
let's pretend you're you're plugin away

163
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:59,680
um

164
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:03,599
and you um for example make a file like

165
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:06,000
this with a header file like this excuse

166
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:07,599
me and a support file like this and this

167
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,199
could be classes or anything right I

168
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:13,639
mean that's what we'll get into very

169
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:15,160
very early on um so we've got where's

170
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:17,960
this I don't know why it's opening

171
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,960
multiple

172
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:23,199
this well anyway you'd need a you'd need

173
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:25,240
you know a support file and then of

174
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:28,080
course the implementation file and then

175
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:30,039
we'd have this guy or I'm sorry this guy

176
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:33,960
um and the way you can do that is

177
00:07:30,039 --> 00:07:37,560
exactly the same gpp or g++ and what

178
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:42,800
you'd want to do here is give it um main

179
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:44,680
2. CPP um and it will um oh I'm sorry

180
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:48,360
I'm in the I'm in a subdirectory so I'd

181
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:52,319
want to change to make main two like so

182
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:55,240
and then I can compile that thing um now

183
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:56,879
you'll see that it's it can't find this

184
00:07:55,240 --> 00:08:00,240
reference and that's because I need to

185
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:02,440
include the header file or I'm sorry the

186
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:04,680
um support file as well I need to

187
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:07,080
compile and Link both of those so in

188
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:09,479
this case I'd want to go main to

189
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:12,240
support. CPP just like that and then

190
00:08:09,479 --> 00:08:14,840
main as well um

191
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:17,879
and uh

192
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:21,360
oh let me do this I think it's trying to

193
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:25,720
run let's go

194
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:25,720
main oops

195
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,919
and

196
00:08:30,159 --> 00:08:34,120
oh well here let me move these back out

197
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:35,560
I tried to get cute with my directories

198
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:37,519
here let's just move these back out here

199
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:42,519
for a sec

200
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:46,240
and do this oh boy

201
00:08:42,519 --> 00:08:50,640
um what did I do

202
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:50,640
here oh I'm still in that subd

203
00:08:55,240 --> 00:09:01,200
directory oh what did I do here let's

204
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,200
see

205
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:12,560
oh I misspelled support here I see so

206
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,839
capitalization obviously matters and we

207
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:17,800
can see it now

208
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:21,839
compiles and uh then we can just run

209
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:21,839
main two support much like we did

210
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:31,440
before I'm sorry dot out there we go and

211
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:35,200
we can see it's doing exactly what we

212
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:37,360
want so um this is an executable um and

213
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:40,160
there's some great errors here right uh

214
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:42,040
because I I made some so I'm kind of

215
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:43,640
glad I messed up not intentional I'll be

216
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,640
honest with you but you can see what

217
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:46,360
happens when you're in the wrong

218
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:49,480
directory and I think this would even

219
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:52,600
work in a subdirectory now uh let's put

220
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:54,959
it back in main two let's put all these

221
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:56,360
main two ones back in there and I think

222
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:59,320
I could have done I think it was because

223
00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:01,200
I just made that one typo so let's let's

224
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:03,200
go and you'd want to change directories

225
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:08,160
right so we'd want to go back into main

226
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:12,480
two like so and then I think we can

227
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:14,360
actually uh see that I bet I get nope it

228
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:16,000
worked there as well oh yeah it's

229
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:17,640
because I was in there so you could work

230
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,519
in subd directors if you got more than

231
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:25,160
one now one thing that doesn't work

232
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:26,720
great is um running uh more than one so

233
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:29,120
like when you've got more than one and

234
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,440
you try to do this it will it really

235
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:33,079
doesn't like when there's more than one

236
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:35,399
main in the project so that's when you'd

237
00:10:33,079 --> 00:10:38,560
want to go to compiling like I just did

238
00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:41,320
here so um that's kind of the that part

239
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:43,040
in a nutshell um on how to how to work

240
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:45,000
on the thing once you've got it working

241
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:47,079
so let's say let's let's go clean this

242
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,000
up a little and say okay I've got this

243
00:10:47,079 --> 00:10:51,200
going and I've read my unit test and

244
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,440
things like that

245
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:56,399
um all right so it's going to make new

246
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:58,720
ones and then um all right we got that

247
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:00,920
this is what it's supposed to do you can

248
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:03,600
uh then then simply uh just grab your

249
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:08,079
url here and go back to

250
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:12,040
Canvas uh oops wrong one

251
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:12,040
uh where canus

252
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:19,680
go oh it's in here sorry you can go into

253
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:23,639
the assignment itself and these are set

254
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:25,680
up then all you have to do is go down

255
00:11:23,639 --> 00:11:28,040
and this looks different for for me as

256
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:30,839
an instructor but and I can't log in

257
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:33,120
unfortunately uh maybe I could do oh we

258
00:11:30,839 --> 00:11:35,839
don't even have any students I don't

259
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:37,760
think let's let's see if this works so I

260
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:39,720
can start the assignment and what you'll

261
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:44,040
get is just this and you can just paste

262
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:47,000
that in there like so and then um or you

263
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:48,880
can even put a web website URL either

264
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,200
one it doesn't matter and that'll just

265
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:52,839
give me the link and let me know that

266
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:55,240
you're done and you can even say I'm

267
00:11:52,839 --> 00:11:57,000
done so you don't need to work worry

268
00:11:55,240 --> 00:12:00,040
with files or anything like that because

269
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:02,680
when you do that then I can go into to

270
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:05,200
here and I can just I can just look at

271
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:07,200
you at your code directly um so we're

272
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:09,760
ready to go I can run it from here I

273
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:12,000
just need to run it um and I can see the

274
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:14,079
exact same stuff you were doing um if

275
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,320
you make folders everything works just

276
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:20,199
fine just swimming link so if I go back

277
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:21,959
into the student view here um there's a

278
00:12:20,199 --> 00:12:25,079
couple other really nice features in

279
00:12:21,959 --> 00:12:26,720
here um if you didn't want to oh and you

280
00:12:25,079 --> 00:12:28,360
can see that I actually highlighted it

281
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:31,040
because I'm actually in here right now

282
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:34,440
and you can even see that up here

283
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:36,320
um so there's documents here you can

284
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:38,399
bring in libraries all kinds of stuff

285
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:41,440
from here um if you're using GitHub

286
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:44,040
there's a GitHub extension here

287
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:45,399
um um I might make automated tests and

288
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:46,560
I'll let you know if I do that which

289
00:12:45,399 --> 00:12:49,320
will kind of give you a clue if you're

290
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:51,800
on the right track um don't really like

291
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:53,399
those yet but they're kind of cool uh

292
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:56,000
let's see what else can you do with this

293
00:12:53,399 --> 00:12:58,920
sucker oh you can you can do a chat as

294
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:03,600
opposed to threads so it's very similar

295
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:06,720
to threads except it's project wide so

296
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:08,800
this project wide and it'll just stay

297
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:11,279
there right and then I could come back

298
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:15,279
in So if I go back over to my instructor

299
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:20,160
view here you can see I have a chat here

300
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:24,079
uh oh sorry chat here and uh I can say

301
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:26,120
yes it is right so we you just get that

302
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:27,839
right back so if you just want General

303
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:30,399
help that's another way to do that and

304
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:32,279
I'll see those um pretty much any time

305
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:33,680
um so if you're if you're offline if

306
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:35,720
you're you know two in the morning it'll

307
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:37,519
just be there when I get up or if it's

308
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:39,040
you know during office hours we can

309
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:40,760
converse that way if you don't want to

310
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:43,440
use microphone in teams like some people

311
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:46,120
don't like to do um you can you can do

312
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:48,880
all that uh lastly I want to show you

313
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:51,560
how to use the debugger which is quite a

314
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:54,920
cool feature um so if you drag a

315
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:59,639
debugger out you can um you can just run

316
00:13:54,920 --> 00:14:02,199
this and I think it's a little funky

317
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:06,000
uh with the multiple files but you can

318
00:14:02,199 --> 00:14:08,320
set break points and uh when you do that

319
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:12,320
um it's going to show them down here and

320
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:14,880
what it does uh is it actually will um

321
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:18,920
oh I'm sorry so when you have more than

322
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:22,519
one uh one file that's that's actually

323
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:24,480
we're going to need to buug out um I'll

324
00:14:22,519 --> 00:14:26,480
put it here I don't think it'll actually

325
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:30,680
trip there and so we bring the debugger

326
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:30,680
out here uh where' It Go

327
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:38,600
why can't I see there it is so we can

328
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:41,079
bring that out and we can uh hopefully

329
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:45,120
play this and it should catch here no

330
00:14:41,079 --> 00:14:45,120
it's not quite doing what it should

331
00:14:47,759 --> 00:14:53,880
here not entirely sure why that's not I

332
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:53,880
think it might

333
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:03,720
be this works quite nicely uh I just

334
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:05,839
can't figure out why that's not getting

335
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:07,600
caught it should stop there and give you

336
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:09,680
some information about what's going on

337
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:12,160
in the file I'll have to look into that

338
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:14,519
but um I do know that works I don't know

339
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:16,279
what I've what I've borked up here in

340
00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:17,680
this demo but just be aware that that

341
00:15:16,279 --> 00:15:19,680
that's useful and it'll what it'll do is

342
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:22,000
it give you variables and you can trace

343
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:24,120
them let's see if I can get it going on

344
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:27,880
my end

345
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:29,319
here let's go into here get that out it

346
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:31,440
might have been because highlighted I

347
00:15:29,319 --> 00:15:36,600
don't know

348
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:36,600
uh so let's let's grab the debugger

349
00:15:44,759 --> 00:15:51,440
here H not quite sure why that's doing

350
00:15:48,839 --> 00:15:53,319
that I'll have to look into that but it

351
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:54,519
certainly works I do know it works I

352
00:15:53,319 --> 00:15:56,519
just don't know why it's not working

353
00:15:54,519 --> 00:15:57,920
right now um might be something to do

354
00:15:56,519 --> 00:15:59,319
with the way I was using the console or

355
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:01,240
something

356
00:15:59,319 --> 00:16:02,880
so that's kind of how you'll work with

357
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:05,079
most of your projects and things like

358
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:06,240
that um get to know the compiler and the

359
