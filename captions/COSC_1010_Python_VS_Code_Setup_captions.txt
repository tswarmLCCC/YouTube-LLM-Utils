hello I wanted to come back to the uh setup section of um cc110 here and get us started uh setting up our programming environment I want I want this to be done very early in the course um for two reasons one we in week two maybe even week one depending on how things shake out that week we'll have a programming assignment and I want to go through uh two things first how to set up our environment um to uh have the tools necessary to do that job and that's job one you know right you know outside of reading the syllabus and doing this week one quiz that we'll talk about here um you know in in week one this uh this um uh um the the uh the weekly material it's in it's in the week one quiz here it's essentially an orientation quiz there's nothing to worry about content wise there it's mainly to uh emphasize that you're familiar with the syllabus but outside of that I really want to make sure we get our tools installed very early so we can troubleshoot problems and set everybody up for Success so to do that I I've put together this uh module at the very top even before week one that has two uh three pages uh but two of them I want I want to call attention to right now and I'll come back to this one um but the main one is it's this python environment setup python is a programming language and uh we're going to set up some tools that let us write programs computer programs um in this class it's it's a it's a programming is is a very it's probably the biggest thing we'll do in in uh in computer science 1010 here in to computer science we're going to study computer science through the lens of programming and as a matter of fact in the first eight weeks we will be doing programming assignments um so it's important that we get this tool set up properly and get you familiar with it very quickly um and that's uh that's what we'll get right into um so there's this page it's just the first link it's called Uh or second link I guess right now python environment setup go in here and you're going to do a few things the first thing you're going to do is download um python and you don't have to use Anaconda um but you can uh Anaconda is a uh education well it's actually more than educational but it is a python environment amongst other things that will serve you well through your academic programming career in Python using Python and and even data science if you go down that road um all you need to do for this though is go here and download this um it'll be quite big you'll download it it'll just it'll look something like this it'll say Anaconda 3 um I'm going to goad and stop this because I already got it installed on my computer there's no reason to download all this it's quite big but go ahead and do it and uh once you've done that uh just run that on whichever environment uh you're using it should work on Mac or PC just fine um when you do that uh you'll be prompted to install python go ahead and do that um so when I say python in this context just to be clear um it's going to to download the program that supports writing programs in Python that's what we mean when we say we download python um not necessarily that we're downloading like the programming language itself we're downloading tools that let us work with it there's a lot in Anaconda and you can use that those tools as well but we're not we're not that's not the recommended way um but you certainly can so don't don't sh away from that if you've done it before or if you want to play with some of the tools in Anaconda like spider or even the development environment that comes with p python called idle those are all fine with me just um I won't I'll be a little more familiar with where you're at if you go this route um and this will probably be the easiest way for beginners to get up and running so once you've got that installed you should be able to go into your start menu um and if you're in Windows uh you should be able to type anaconda and see things like Anaconda Navigator prompt all that you don't need to worry about any of that just to but but just to make sure that it's installed the next you'll do is you'll go out and install um a Microsoft product called Visual Studio code and that will look like this um and again I've already done this on this computer but you'd grab either windows or probably Mac for most of you um and uh and download it and install it again it's a very simple click click install type of installer so hopefully that doesn't go too to it doesn't it isn't too difficult for you while you're doing that though while you're in installing visual studio um these two options by default are off I recommend turning them on and I'll show you why in just a second they they make they'll make your life just a little easier at least in Windows uh do make sure that you add to path um really you can just kind of mimic this so once you've done that once you've installed Visual Studio code um you can again go to your start menu or if it installed it locally like this you can run it from here um I'm going to close the one I have open right now uh and then just open it so we have uh uh just to kind of show you what it might look like when you're first starting up so if you've never run it before you might go to your start menu and just either type Visual Studio code or like on on uh um Windows uh 11 here you can just type vs code even um and it'll start to to pull those up um you might have to navigate some menus or things like that but you should be able to get it so uh what that'll launch is a window that looks like this um and it might have some updates and things like that's it's a little complicated if you've never been in here um and and yours might not look like this let me actually not sure entirely how to close these things out um but the upshot of it is is the next thing we'll want to do is go to extensions here uh which is this one this little with like three little blocks here and one sticking out go and click that and just type python up here and you're going to be looking for the python extension and uh I've already got it installed but it would ask you to install it here and this is all covered um the uh under the uh under this guide as well um right here so this is really all you're trying to do there um other than that you should be pretty much ready to go so what you'll want to do then is uh we're going to make a Hello World and this this whole thing if everything goes right you should be able to do this um uh right here within Visual Studio code and it should run so what we're going to do is um we will go back into Visual Studio code and we'll make a new file new file and we're going to type uh you can either just do this I just type usually just go like hello.py so py here is a file extension and that just tells our computer that this is a python file py stands for Python and it will know what to do with it um so it's handy to and and and conventional to name it uh name any file with pi hello is just the name of the file you could call it anything it that part's inconsequential um so I'm going to just save this to my homework directory and I'll I'll come back to this concept in just a sec as well I'm just gonna oops as I so I'm just going to create that and um we should get uh I think I accidentally open something I'm just going to do it again make hello hello.py like so and just create it that opens it in our in our integrated development environment um also known as IDE and uh we're going to type our first programming command called print hello right so what this is is is a what's called a function and it's just saying take this word here uh in English and print it to the screen um and we're going to test that because that's our primary goal and you can do that by dropping down this menu and just say run python file and what'll happen here is if it wasn't already up it will bring up what's called a terminal which is um a way of the computer with to interact with us um and it it prints out our message and you can see it mimics exactly what we put up here as a matter of fact we can actually use this as a bit of a a first experiment we can say hello CC 1010 and uh you might predict that uh this uh will change this message down here to do uh to print this out instead in its place so let's go and test that out and hit hit our play button here and certainly we see that we we've had success um just just a little uh little information for you um the terminal here what what's going on here is it's saying this all of this stuff right here this part right here is where I'm running and I want to make you familiar with that especially because in the next video actually I might even do it in this video I think I will because this is a little shorter than I thought it would be um I'm going to go over how to kind of download and run our assignments no I'll do that in the next video because I I need to do one other thing but make sure you you kind of know where you're working in is kind of my point and you can you can learn that by examining this what's called a path it's it's it's a path on your file system um and then the rest of this is basically just stuff saying how do I run this you can disregard this for where we are in this course but it's basically saying I'm going to go out and run that Python program that we downloaded and I'm going to run it against this file that you just told me to run against that's what's going on here and here's the output you'll get quite familiar with this environment um if you break something like you leave a quote off you'll get something quite different and as a matter of fact you can see it's kind of like oh my goodness this guy doesn't know what he's doing and you'll get an error it's called the error is just our Python Programming saying you've given me something I don't understand and uh in this case it's because when you use uh text like this in a in MO almost any programming language you have to tell it what parts of the program are computer program Parts commands which is this part and this quote you need to basically put this in what's called a function is what's going on here and then it takes this part which you might recall from our very first video we have input and then we uh goes into our Black Box our Black Box this time is a program called print so it's taking our input and it's doing something with that which is our output which is again spitting out our our our our our output here so um this is our very first computer program and this is actually your your week one assignment is to do this and uh basically send me a screenshot or a picture of it running this week and uh that that's enough of uh uh uh for this very first week um to to complete your assignment um other than the week one quiz which is of course uh quite important as well so um I think that's enough on the setup but it's it's crucial crucial that you get at least this much done this week um so that's kind of the the the the beginner uh version of this setup there's a lot of cool things that Python and visual studio can code can do for us and I hope to get into that and if you have questions immediately ask them I'd love to jump down that but I don't want to overwhelm you with all the tools that we have right away here um if for some reason you run into a difficulty and you can't get a hold of me immediately either with my office hours or our open lab hours um I did create a discussion item in the uh in the discussions part of our course over here that you can use to um to get get a hold of me and I'll keep a pretty close eye on this most of the course so this is another way to get a hold of me right away um so I'm gonna I'm going to stop this video here and then I'll get into kind of how to uh really finish week one here as we go um and I'll reference this there and uh oh one other thing I I do want to note sorry um you might there might be a few places in the shell and in assignments where I reference a uh programming and enironment called replit um unfortunately um on on January or December 7th here uh right before I was ready to publish the whole thing uh repet the company got rid of their free version that we were going to use it's an educational version um and I had to move back to visual studio code here so if you see things in repet which was a in online thing it might look a little different we've got all the same tools though um and I'll explain them as we go um and the only difference is we'll have to submit files back and forth again instead of just submitting them um in uh in repet which would have been really cool okay let me get into uh the general overview of submitting assignments here and even our our uh first assignment overview all right be back in a bit
