um we're picking right back up in our in our python Basics or I'm sorry python kind of building blocks or or um fundamentals series uh with in in in our study of functions here um talking about now list uh list functionality and some of the features that are built into the list class that gives us um a lot of the functionality that other languages don't have out of the gate um the first is of course index um here we can see that we've got a list here just a simple sequence and we can get at individual items here using um indexes um so you can read this as my list Sub Zero or my list position zero my list zero um that's how I usually say it is my less Subzero um and you can assign those out so we'll see here when I run this that uh the first and second element get assigned the first and second element of course we could change that do the fourth element if we wanted to there's nothing special about the sequences where we get one and five um and then if we access one that's out of range so if I go to like 14 here we get an erir a value ER usually is what that will give us uh sorry an index ER in this case it's a it's a subset of a value error uh when we get to the um error handling units you'll understand what I'm talking about a little bit more there um but the errors have types in this case it's an index eror that's gets thrown basically saying you don't have one uh of it doesn't quite go that far out um is a way to read that so let's just change this spect to two but the main point is we can get directly at these things in a lot of different ways um another very convenient way um that uh is is quite hard to do in other programming lers or at least complex is to get things from the last element um so here we'll see that we get five and four by using the negative syntax so negative one would give us the first item at the uh the last element and the second to last element gives us the second to last so negative 1 and -2 respectively this would be 1 this would be -2 as it comes out from 1 2 3 4 um in other programming languages you might recall if you've studied it all study those at all you basically need to use a length function on a on a on a an array or other item or other uh you know vectors and q's and things like that to um figure out how long the length is and then index that backwards uh to do the same trick so being able to just do this with shorthand and um and without you know something like length you know length minus one you know uh things like that very very handy in Python huge feature in Python that's built right into the language for us um another really useful feature and one of my favorites are is this idea of slicing um I've talked about this briefly but the short version of it all is is that um you can uh basically grab items between this is the the between operator in this context this colon uh saying give me all the items between uh position one and position four uh and of course four and one are the uh Second and and uh fifth items uh I'm sorry second and fourth items uh so it' be second third and fourth items um in this context because we start with zero um so you might might recall that our first item was Subzero here we start with the position zero as many computer programs do or or or languages do so one is actually the second item here that's what's going on there and of course we can return that back out to variable and we get a new list so this assignment this uh um operation will give a new list when you slice you get a new list we'll see later in the video that if you just assign a list to another list it actually doesn't do that it's a reference then um but slicing makes a new list um so we can certainly see that my list here let's go ahead and do that we can see that my list here uh code my list it it has all five but the slice this this one um it would only turns the three so it's a it's a new list it's essentially a copy and then a a reduced set um there's another uh operation here um this part is zero through five this is exactly what we saw before but then there's a step operator so if you see a third colon it's basically saying give me every other one if that makes sense so if I run this we'll see we get one three and five instead of one two three four five and that's because of this operation so this is returning position 0 through five um or index0 through five and giving us every other one that's basically what's going on there with that um hopefully that makes sense uh but let's go a and change that so here we see 135 if I did for example three it will give me zero and four so let's get give me every third one um and then it runs out of course of juice it doesn't have any more there we go um and there's no no uh it can't go to um uh it can't go any further than that now if we let's go back up and redefine my list just for a sec add a few more let's go six seven eight 9 10 like so uh and run that because we need to reload this now we're we're redefining my list um if we now go back and uh and run this one where' it go there it is we'll see that we do get a little bit more code uh did I not run that I thought I ran it let's let's make sure we get that why is that's fine but why didn't this work what did I do here oh it's because I'm slicing it so this is a good good uh example I'm only I'm only asking it to do this between the positions of zero and five so but if I change this to 10 or nine in this case uh we'll see we get more uh my mistake but you can see how you do that and as a matter of fact we can even start later right if we use our slicer to change that start position we'll just get four and seven or well 3 n and six because it's starting there and giving me every third one um so some really interesting Behavior there so remember this happens first and you can see that here I still get three because I'm starting at position three in this case and it's saying okay give me give me those three um so pretty handy uh if you ever need to do such things right right built in you don't need to write a custom for Loop or anything to that end to do that kind of work um let's see I think I'm going to quickly stop here uh so these are just ways to slice and get at things of lists and then we'll get into modification of lists in the next video so I'm going to quickly jump in and out and come up with my Cory intro again and we'll be right back
