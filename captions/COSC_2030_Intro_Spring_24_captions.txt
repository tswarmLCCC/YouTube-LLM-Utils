hello and welcome to class um this is just a quick course orientation video to make sure you understand where most of the big course features are understand what to do especially in week one but week to week and then we'll also go through the syllabus and Grading um and make sure that that's all well and understood here so getting right into it um this is an asynchronous class meaning we will not meet in live meet not meet live at all um in a required manner um I will have Labs though available on campus uh right now I've got them set up for Wednesday and Thursday um uh in the um uh education enrichment center eec and BT uh the the business center um both are on the second floor um and those numbers uh will be the room numbers will be in the syllabus right now BT is going to be in 222 and I think that's on Thursday and then the e will be on Wednesday afternoon so it's Wednesday afternoon and Thursday uh morning to give you two different options there you don't have to come to these by the way these are just kind of uh um a place for all three of my different courses um for students to come and get live lectures or help from me um in a live format it's just what I kind of do to provide oncampus support on top of the office hours that you can sign up for uh let's see uh one thing to be note of uh the week that we start class I will not be there after I just said I'm doing this to be there um I'll be in a conference uh in New Orleans that week I'm going to try to hold a sync session that night um and again sync sessions are optional and I'll post in the announcements whereing we're going to do them um just answer questions is really what they're for um basically everything in your week to week should be in this in this uh section I'm happy to do live lectures again if that's benefici beneficial for you but um everything should be in the course shell that you need to succeed including the the really in-depth lectures that I do and um and the zybook reading should handle a lot of that too um one thing though that you absolutely do need to do week uh week one here um down here in in the in the uh course shell is this week one quiz and all this is is a simple I've read the uh read the um read the uh syllabus type of quiz there's not very much to it um you can take as many times as you can um but basically the reason you have to do this is It's how we take attendance the first week um and make sure that you're in class and that uh that uh you're so if you don't take it by Friday they drop you basically I need to I need to drop you it's it's part of part of the policy so make sure you get this particular week one quiz 2023 done that first week you'll also do a quick discussion board um introduction and you can read about some other things like the final project and things like that but the only thing that's due are these two the week one assignment and the discussion and then we'll get into uh our our our formal study starting in week two with abstract data types and we'll have an assignment and things like that um so I'm going to jump into the syllabus now uh let's go to word hopefully word comes back up come on word you can do it oh I closed my syus give me one SEC uh one sec let's go had to re-upload it I I found something I I missed there we go sorry about that and uh let's just resize this so it looks a little bit better and we will move me up here for now hopefully that's not in the way um so let's uh let's see if we get a better read mode out this that's a little bit better um so as mentioned this is uh computer programming to this in the future this might be known as uh structured programming or structured programming in C++ but right now it's called programming to um let's see that is actually not true anymore have to delete that we are asynchronous um and we are recorded I'll leave that but I'll update that later um sorry about that need to re-upload those uh my my name is Trevor swarm uh I'm the in uh computer science instructor at LC uh the only full-time one right now my office uh this year in 20123 24 is uh BT 2113 it's the uh business building second floor um and I'm right back by those four gaming computers if you want to come find me please do anytime uh my office uh phone number and email address are here um and as I said we've got kind of like kind kind of got a lab uh set set up for it and this is really what I should be putting up here um so I will go ahead and do that real quick sorry about I just didn't see that this time location uh we'll just put that there like that for now and we'll go we'll I'll clean that up in just a bit sorry about that um and republish again uh let's see so um y there's my contact information contact me anytime um phone or email is fine I I'll keep a pretty close watch on that uh we start like as you know the 16th uh finish on May 10th um I cannot do instruction after May 10th is the only thing to keep in word there keep keep in mind there so our last class will be there and then we'll have uh another week for the final project um yep and this is just a note of that that introductory quiz um and then some information you can get 100% refund by the 29th uh the last day to draw is April 1st um Enrollment Services can help you with all of that some information just about the uh course itself here um let's see student work um I do allow you to work together in this class and even to use um online tools including chat gbt um but be aware that I the work it needs to be your own um you have to turn in your own work you're ultimately responsible for it so when you're actually doing the code do that your yourself but if you find more your find yourself more comfortable asking uh your classmates for help other than me uh please do so that's certainly fine um I don't mind that at all that's part of programming same thing is true of using AI I but uh be aware um if I suspect that you're sharing a little too much with your classmates or AI is writing all of your code for you or basically writing your code for you um I reserve the right to ask you to come in and um basically tell me what's going on um and I might I might do that anyway just just to you know kind of make sure that you're getting it um you know these asynchronous classes it's hard when you can't look people in the eye so if I haven't been talking to you very much and and and uh and I see a drastic change in coding style from week to week or um or or things like that um we might have a conversation and it's not meant to be punitive I just want to make sure that you're getting everything you can out of the class um um and it's one way it's it's the only way frankly that I can protect a academic Integrity in a class like this um so that that's what that's all about the reading material is an online um an online um product called zybook um and I can show you what it looks like here let me jump back over to Chrome uh real quick and just pop one open this is what ours looks like um this year it's it'll be called CC 2030 Computer Science 2 and you will have guided learning I've set these up ahead of time and they're linked in each module I'll go over that back in canvas when I come back to it actually I'll probably just do it right after that um but the reason I've chosen this I'll just use one of these is um they've got some nice guided learning so what you'll do is like you you'll be uh you know reading uh reading the captions here and it will talk about what's going on with a data structure or something to that end it really does a good job with memory management and that's the main reason I chose it I'm sorry with not its own memory management describing memory management we get to things like pointers and things like that and there will be some quizzes in here and things like that all all these are required you're graded on this be aware of that it ships a grade back to me on Wednesday evening um and that will be part of your grade it's I think 20% of your gr it's easy easy points um but this is basically how I have chosen to mimic what we would do in a classroom in a offline you know at your own pace format um do this early start it um they open on Saturday morning and they're due Wednesday evening uh so started them early um and get through that I uh intend for you to have read this before you watch the lecture videos there's nothing requiring that but I do intend for that um this is kind of your primary input on occasion I will uh offer uh either other YouTube videos other than my own lecture or even other reading materials when I when I have a book in this case I think it's data structures of C++ by green tea um that has good material on the weekly topic that you can take with you uh green tea is free um so I I I do try to link those when I can and then I've authored several pages in canvas that you're more than welcome to copy and keep for yourself as well so that's the reading um and and then that's how that'll work in canvas let's go back and show you what a module might look like um and then I'll get jump jump back into the syllabus and talk about grading but like let's go to like I let's go to like this one so you know in a in a typical week we may have assigned like structures and Abstract data type you'll start with this week overview here and uh it's basically just some learning objectives and a bit of introductory text that I've written um and then I'll link the guided learning here if not you can just refer back to the zybook because they're there as well um and then I you most of the time I will have created a video unless it's like a carryon week and these are in YouTube just like this pretty simple stuff um and it will refer back there's multiple times you will see the same stuff and um and then there's an assignment link this one says repet by the way um in a when I first built this course we were going to use an online tool called repet which is great and I might even try to go back to it um because what it does is it uh lets you code in a browser um Unfortunately they dropped support for it in December so I had to change everything back to use Visual Studio code so you will need to download visual studio code um and get it configured for C++ and you will find a zip file in instead when I get these updated here in a bit uh to download the the um the starter code the lesson code and then your the starter code for your assignment um each week there's going to be several examples um both for um Standalone examples for that I use in the lecture that I I Supply in the zip file but then there's also called a prim Prim p r i mm assignment um in most uh modules that that stands for um preview run investigate uh modify and make the the first four are optional but they're basically coding assignments that I um that are guided with the comments in the code to help you get in there and give you either give you some working code uh that you can use or or help you modify into working code um on top of the supported examples so you should have multiple files that have working code based on the unit that you can refer to um very very uh very infrequently I will have you code these things up from scratch that's just kind of not what we do in in computer programming we big steel and borrow code all the time and I'm going to provide you uh with that and that'll be a good part of your weekly learning little handh holding there with a gradual release as we go um that uh that being said there uh is a final project and it will be the the the probably the thing you write by the the most and um you can read about it and I think I put it in week one yes it's a simulation so what you'll do in this one is you will basically be writing a uh poker hand simulation it's a classic C++ uh kind of uh kind of assignment um you'll be using object-oriented programming to build out a uh a deck of cards you know 52 you know standard poker uh deck and uh what we'll do in this is we will take a um a we'll draw five cards randomly and assess like what kind of hand it is like a pair two pair three a kind full house flush Royal Flush all those things and we're going to do that many many times and this is called a Monte Carlo simulation and what we're going to do is basically assign uh or count how many times these happen and see how they stack up with uh theoretical uh odds uh and see how those play out each week you will also have a um discussion that like this one's for while Loops that will basically um uh take the week's learning and as a class you'll discuss how you'll use that in the final that's mostly what we do unless there's a reason not to sometimes We'll add add uh you know a different one uh for a specific unit or things like that but that's typically what you do all of that is graded as well you'll need do one by Wednesday evening that'll be an initial post of your own creation don't refer to your student your your other classmates stuff just write it on your own um and post it that's kind of your own understanding and then U by Friday two days later um you'll you'll respond to one other discussion um uh in in here um and that's basically how we take attendance in an online class is this discussion item so make sure you do this as well this is is graded the assignment is graded and the guided learning stuff is graded every week those are the big three um um so those are the big stuff there let's see am I missing anything in canvas while I'm here I might come back to this um oh yeah why I'm so this stuff uh everything I'm covering here um is linked in here Linked In This getting started start here and I'll reference this in the first announcement for week one uh the link to the syllabus is here I'm a short uh kind of breakdown of what we might cover in class um the grading and then basically the stuff we just talked about so you'll have guided learning lectures which are not graded of course because that's just you listening to me those discuss the prim tasks the assignment which are graded and the discussion forms which are graded you might notice that a lot of the the guided learning and the discussion forms are basically it's a lot of free points doing that intentionally um I I I've structured the class I've put a lot of work into the class for these guided learnings to be kind of a way to guide you through this and the bulk of your learning should help there I'm hoping that when you get to the assignment it's almost trivial by the time you get there um if that's not the case please let me know let let's let's work together on that um the other big thing to do starting week one right day one is to download and install a C++ environment and I've worked you through the process of installing one called Visual Studio code here um in this example um this is a great way to do it um if you struggle with this please let me know as early as possible you'll be writing code in week two and if you can't compile that code you're going to fall behind so um you send me emails um even at the conference I'm I'm willing to try to meet with you online um and things like that at night and and get that set up and worst case we can fall back to um the online environment and get get you going there um if you don't have a computer that's capable of running Visual Studio code um Mac uh PC and Linux all can run Visual Studio code by the way and they're all linked here uh if you don't have one the library has some the the LC library has some that you can check out um and then we or we could use the labs we can use the computer labs as well if you want to just work on campus all great options there let's see weekly assignments um I Do cover the weekly assignment General instructions here this is again repeated there some general ideas though on like organizing your code downloading the zip file things like that um opening the file with Visual Studio code following the prim assignment and then turning it in just uh um basically uh it's very very much just like canvas um you'll submit MIT a file or a zip file um if you have multiple files to the uh the assignment post um is is all you do to turn these things in um let's go back to the syllabus here uh oops did not mean to open that uh word there you are let's finish that up um the zbook uh you'll need to buy through the um through the bookstore so make sure you do that there um here's the ISBN number they'll know which one it is though that we we got that all sored away with them just make sure you buy the one that's called computer science too because we use iBooks for uh COC 1010 and 2409 as well so make sure you get the one that is 42030 um just a blurb on rating and things like that uh make sure that you get things set up um just like we talked about the course competencies of course the things you'll learn in this class um the grading the homework um it's 30% of your grade U those are weekly assignments they should be again not too hard I hope um they're designed that way um I haven't decided if I'm going to do a midterm yet if I don't the final project will be worth 30% of the grade if not they'll be worth 15% but the two big the the the projects are going to be 30% your grade so um and then the other um the other um uh uh does that add up right did I add that yeah I did okay the other 40% are the discussions and the guided learning the guided learning is just the reading and make sure you do the online activities um 20% that's a lot of free points there the discussions are another 40% or 20 um very standard uh grading scale um just 90 20 you know 90 80 70 60 um cuts for for the letter grades that we'll assign and um if anything um I'm going to curve up I won't curve down um so we'll see how that goes as we get going um the only other thing is please let me know ahead of time if you are not going to get things turned in on time I will not extend it if you let me know on Friday at 11 o'clock that you're not going to get it done that's too late um I expect you to only use the extensions for when something's coming up like you've been very sick and missed class or something's come up you know with your family or things like that um this is not something to to use every week um if you're falling behind that's a different discussion come find me and we'll talk about that um we talked about academic Integrity a little bit but basically uh don't cheat um you know you can talk and in design code and everything with your friends um or or classmates feel free to work in groups on things but at the end of the day work on your own code turn it in I expect you to document your own code um uh again I reserve the right to kind of quiz you about about what you did in a program at any time um other than that we're just kind of going over the same stuff we're going to class incomplete grids just standard um standard stuff for LC uh make sure you make yourself familiar with this I went over the dates earlier and accommodations if you need any accommodations meet uh with student services they'll be happy to help you um I'm not equipped to do that myself but I will certainly work with them if that is something we need to do um other than that I think we've kind of covered everything um make sure yep so again um make sure no matter what you do this first week when you're reading this make sure that you get this quiz done this quiz done in week one make sure that happens and make sure that you get your C++ environment uh installed when you do do that you should be able to run code and execute it and all that there's plenty of videos on here I think I do it about four times in the first three weeks where I kind of show how to run code and things like that so oops didn't realize that I did not switch back over to Chrome sorry about that but uh I was referring to this this video and this quiz so anyway welcome to class I'm thrilled to have you here um I'm very excited about this class I think it'll be a fun one uh a little bit challenging um this is kind of um a really um one of these classes where the rubber hits the road a little bit in terms of your your computer science career um but I am very um excited and um and humbled to be be your instructor to guide you through that journey I can't wait to see you in person um if we do that um after I get back from my my stinking conference this first week but uh anyway good luck in class and uh let me know if you have any questions thank you
