hello welcome to computer science 10:30 here at l c um this uh is is uh programming one um not to be confused with the introduction to computer programming or introduction to computer science that's cc110 um and I believe uh everybody that's in this class should have taken that class uh and that one is in Python this one's actually in C++ uh a programming language that's a little bit older and a little bit more more um structured than python was so um it'll be a bit of a different structure than probably some of the things that you're used to I'm going to move my daughter's little chair here with her uh blanket she kind of left that out um in this video I just want to introduce the class Set uh help you uh you know navigate the shell and the syllabus um and then point you in the right direction to get you started on setting up a few things um that we'll uh that we'll use throughout the of course so um the uh the shell is using our new let me see if I can make this just a little wider um to to help with that the uh the shell is using our new format this year um for LC um that help this should be um the uh it should be the same for all of your courses hopefully um so we have this course overview here which is basically just a getting started page um that is uh it basically mirrors what I'm doing here um uh there's a ribbon here so you can click these and expand them um but everything I'm going through here is also contained in this course overview page oops sorry let me just move that back um this is an asynchronous class which means that we do not meet online um uh I have videos every week that are required and I'll go over how that looks for you in just a bit um and there's a page to that end but we do not meet uh in a required format uh you're more than welcome welcome to come visit me um a lot of the times I I'm very generous with my office hours and often we even re-lecture during office hours but know that there's no live lectures that are required those are all online and I want to reiterate that because some people did not understand that in in my previous semester your required lectures uh are online and they are required you're supposed to watch those every week um so uh the uh the um and uh well let's just continue with um with the shell here this homepage will take you uh back back to here at the course home or or back actually to here which is um basically got that link and then all of your modules here um and then uh and then uh the other thing to watch out for though are announcements those um those will pop up in your email box your student email box but they look like this as well they're in this announcement things on the left these are from the previous semester they imported with uh with my shell here um I'll make new ones as we go it's only it's actually June right now when I'm recording this but um this is where I'll announce what's going on if I make changes to the course office hours things like that or how things are going um that's what I'll do with announcements um the uh course is uh is organized uh through what are called modules these are typically units of study and almost all of them are one week in length but some of them are two um and what those usually have is uh is we'll have a um a course o or a module overview page or unit overview page which describes your week um and then that will give you um the lecture information some topical pages and then the module usually uh will uh include a discussion and a um a discussion and an assignment as well as the required lectures uh you can check your grades in the course at any point I'm very good about grading I usually gr grade on Saturday morning um most of my stuff is due Friday evening that's a little bit different than some other courses will do uh so I'm most of my stuff is due on Friday evening but you can see all of that uh you can see the assignments in their due dates and your grades uh in the shells uh are in these uh places to navigate here and here so again I'm still I'm still setting up the course but this is that's where you can go go through them you can also see your assignments in your grades and then again in the modules so that's a good way to kind of keep uh keep up on things you can also use your calendar here these will appear on your calendar uh make sure you don't turn them off but you can you can do that as well lots of ways to keep kind of keep up um and then the syllabus I'll I'll go into the syllabus and just a sec that's where I'm going next uh we do have a required resource it's called zybooks uh it's actually 1030 not uh 1010 um the uh ISBN here is correct but the uh I I got the title wrong I I because I I actually imported this and let's call this programming one so anyway the idea of the zybook and I'll bring it up here is that it's an online resource um the the these are required every week as well um that's another um another problem that we had in a previous section let me just bring up zybooks real quick uh let's see this is an online uh resource that you have to buy this is something something you need to purchase and what it looks like is this and we have these assignments in them and they have points associated with them um these will have due dates uh probably the end of the semester uh is what I'll set these to but these are due on that Friday um so whenever you have a uh uh a unit it will have a guided learning it's called and you'll go through these things and uh you know kind of kind of you know uh go through these interactive uh kind of demonstrations some text and then there's some activities associated with these things um again I want to reiterate you have to do these there's 10 points a week associated with these and it's its own category a lot of students fall behind on their grade because they don't do this um so make sure you do it make sure you do these activities you'll get points for it um and you can check that at any time in your grade it scores automatically as you go if that's not working for you for some reason let me know immediately and we'll get that scored away but it's it's it's a big deal and I want to make sure that you're you're you're more than where that that's required um let's see here I don't know why that says 101 uh that's interesting I wonder what happened there I'll have to take a look at that um oh I think I you know what I'm in the wrong class is what's going on there uh here we go let's go to the right one uh everything I said is true there but uh yeah that's uh that's what was going on um so anyway course overview same stuff uh though there there's nothing new here um uh the required resource yeah here we go yeah I actually did have it set up correctly I just was in the wrong thing um the other thing that you need to know um and and I have a whole page on this in a video on that page is that we use an online resource called repet to do our programming this sets up C++ for you so you don't have to deal with uh setting up the compiler we do have some other Pages for that if you want to use Visual Studio but repet is how you'll turn your stuff in um and there's a whole page and a whole video for that I'm not going to go through that in this video but uh make sure you refer to that as a matter of fact you can uh kind of see what that looks like here well that's repet itself um our startup page looks like this um and basically you will set up uh an online account with rep they're free with your school email and you'll do your work in in these in these uh projects and you can you can um run them right there if you have any problems with that please again let me know um there's uh just general programming knowledge at the introductory level probably if you if if you taking computer science uh intro to computer science CC 1010 you're more than set up for this and then using a web browser um uh like I said you are required to use the uh guided learning every week um and you're required to do your weekly discussions and ass and assignments I I say each week sometimes there's two we units it's very rare though um the there's videos in the unit overview page uh that are required um and then I push announcements like I already said uh I have an office hours page here right now it's set up like it was last year where um where uh the uh the uh I'm actually moving offices so I'll update this I'll be down in ARP next year um but uh we'll set this up basically uh uh depending on student needs uh right now now uh if nothing changes it's from 9:00 to 11: on Tuesdays and Wednesdays and 1: to 3 on Thursdays and you can either come live and we can grab a classroom and I can do uh you know we can do do things uh you know with the the the smartboards and all that stuff or you can use the zoom link uh that's provided here that we just I always start that up to and keep an eye on that so I do both it's kind of a hybrid type of office hours uh but it's worked well for students in the past let's see here um and then lastly just a little bit of my information here uh my my email address um and then uh if you've uh if you if you have um an issue that um you're not comfortable coming to me with my supervisor is Dr Aron nitki um and then there is a uh there's another one down door that I can't quite scroll down to let's go ahead and see if I can fix this browser just a bit so I can scroll down there we go Brian Wilson is uh is is over all of us uh in the Arts and Sciences uh you can get a hold of them uh there as well so um what a module looks like uh just going back to our um our our homepage here is uh is this so let's pretend we're in the math unit here um you what you would do is you would go into this unit overview here and I'm going to move that over here just so I could go back and forth you'd go into the unit overview here and this is where you start and kind of live um the assignment the guided learning and the discussion are linked separately so you can find them quickly here without going to the assignments uh page but your your required material is on this unit overview so get used to doing that every week um there I I wrote a little bit of an intro every week uh and just describing what's going on with the week and the intent uh and then there's learning objectives uh just kind of a quick statement of what you should be looking forward to getting done that week um so on and so forth and then we get into the required reading uh which again links to the zybook and which um which uh unit you'll be doing in there uh those are again required and but those are also linked right here so you can you you could just click this um on on your module page and then lastly um but also very importantly we have these required lecture videos on this third tab um where I've uh embedded these here these are just YouTube videos um that cover the material mostly from the zybook but I emphasize the things that um you know matter for the course uh the the um the uh the uh assignment and certainly the final um there's two types of these uh the first is the the required uh lecture videos those are all done that's what these look like and then every week I'll build another one usually uh describing you know what went well what didn't go well um anything I want to talk about and then I I I usually introduce um and and walk through the homework uh quite a bit both uh what we are going to do in the coming week but what how how things went in the previous week that we just got done so uh just a little bit there um so in this week there would be three and you can just play them right here if you want to this unit we are going to start to just going to unmute or mute myself you can make them full screen like that if you want that's basically just typical YouTube stuff um you can even just go to YouTube uh most of these uh will sometimes they have optional videos uh these are just things that I wanted to record and talk about um there's um I'd say it's about 50/50 whether there's something there or not and then the same thing with reading and notes I might add things as I find them that relate to that unit but again you don't have to spend your time on those unless you're really um interested before you jump into these I would and and if if you're struggling I would um I would uh suggest you come come speak to me about that so uh let's see is there anything else I want to talk about um in terms of the actual shell not really but one thing I will highlight is that um the way I'm going to set up this class I haven't quite finished it yet is there's going to be a unit uh a final unit unit down here final project and I don't even think I've started it yet um uh oh nope I did and so what I'll do is I'll break this out into um into several weekly units um and so the final is not just going to be done at the end of the class in in this course what we're going to do is probably have two or three assignments related to it um the first one will be due the first quarter or the first six weeks basically saying how do you plan to approach this and that's kind of my way to check in to make sure that what you're going to do is going to work um and maybe course correct a little bit and then what we'll probably do from there is basically build about half of it um and and and turn that in and kind of have a structure of what's going on the idea here is I don't I don't want people to put off the final and I want you to be able to relate uh a lot of this stuff we learn week to week to the final so I want to keep it in your brain and also this way we can avoid this the shock of a big project at the end um my previous class um we did a similar format in terms of delivery but the the final kind of crept up on people and it was a big thing so anyway I'm going to stop this video here um and then quickly go over the uh syllabus uh hopefully so uh or I mean hopefully it's quick so anyway uh more on that in just a sec
