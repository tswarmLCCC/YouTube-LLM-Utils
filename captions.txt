1
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:04,220
I think it's time for a little story

2
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:06,300
 

3
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:11,440
It's definitely Storytime

4
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:14,360
 

5
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:48,840
It was the night before,

6
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:50,560
when all through the world

7
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:53,240
no words, no dreams, then one day

8
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:55,280
A writer by a fire,

9
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,040
imagined all of Gaia

10
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,780
took a journey into a child-man's heart

11
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:01,060
A painter on the shore

12
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:03,260
imagined all the world

13
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:05,620
within a snowflake on his palm

14
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:08,880
Unframed by poetry, a canvas of awe

15
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:13,160
Planet Earth falling back into the stars

16
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:16,320
I am the voice of never, never land

17
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,660
the innocence, the dreams of every man

18
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:22,420
I am the empty crib of Peter Pan,

19
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:25,300
a soaring kite against the blue, blue sky

20
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:28,240
every chimney, every moonlit sight

21
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:31,480
I am the story that will read you real

22
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,200
every memory that you hold dear

23
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:56,540
I am the journey

24
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:57,900
I am the destination

25
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,200
I am the home; the tale that reads you

26
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:02,860
A way to taste the night

27
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:03,860
the elusive high

28
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:05,580
Follow the madness

29
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:07,120
Alice, you know you once did

30
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,200
Imaginarium, a dream emporium

31
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,540
Caress the tales and

32
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:13,140
they will dream you real

33
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:14,820
A storyteller's game,

34
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,200
lips that intoxicate

35
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,140
The core of all life is a limitless chest of tales

36
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:24,100
I am the voice of never, never land

37
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:26,900
the innocence, the dreams of every man

38
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,000
I am the empty crib of Peter Pan

39
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,720
A soaring kite against the blue, blue sky

40
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,920
every chimney, every moonlit sight

41
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:39,180
I am the story that will read you real

42
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:43,880
Every memory that you hold dear

43
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:48,420
I am the voice of never, never land

44
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,520
the innocence, the dreams of every man

45
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:55,680
Searching heavens for another earth

46
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,580
Innocence, innocence,

47
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:45,180
dreams of every man, ah-ah

48
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:47,580
Every man, innocent

49
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:49,700
every man, Peter Pan

50
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:53,700
Innocence, innocence

51
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:57,700
dreams of every man, aah-aah

52
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:59,700
Every man, innocent

53
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:01,700
every man, Peter Pan

54
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:07,400
Oh ooh aah aah aaah

55
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:14,180
Oh ooh aah aah aaaaaaaaah

56
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,300
I am the voice of never, never land

57
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:22,260
the innocence, the dreams of every man

58
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:25,060
I am the empty crib of Peter Pan

59
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:28,320
A soaring kite against the blue, blue sky

60
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:31,060
every chimney, every moonlit sight

61
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:34,400
I am the story that will read you real

62
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,480
Every memory that you hold dear

63
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:44,060
I am the voice of never, never land

64
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:46,800
the innocence, the dreams of every man.

65
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,680
I am the empty crib of Peter Pan

66
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,320
A soaring kite against the blue, blue sky

67
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,520
every chimney, every moonlit sight

68
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:59,400
I am the story that will read you real

69
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:05,200
Every memory that you hold dear

70
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:08,480
Oh ooh oh-oh-oooooh

71
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:11,320
Oh oh oh-ooooh

72
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:14,380
Ooooooh

73
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:20,960
Whoa-oooooooh

74
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:24,880
Heeeeey-ey-ey

75
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:28,400
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah
